Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing\nefficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications.\nTo address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data\nlocally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to\ncollect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated\nlearning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep\nlearning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the\ndata analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with\nminimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient\narchitectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would\nbe advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a\nmicroservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be\nstructured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable\nentities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated\nlearning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible,\nand extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations\nto the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the\nprivacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an\nIoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly\navailable dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the\nproposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images,\ncomprising 25 malware classes and one benign class.

In QIF there are two main perspectives\nfor the quantification of leakage. On one hand, the static perspective\nconsiders all possible runs of the system in the computation of information\nflow, and is usually employed when preemptively deciding whether or not to run\nthe system. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a\nspecific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all\nother runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and\ntrackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular\nrun based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the\nstatic perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic\nperspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper\nwe take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:\n(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the\nadversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on\nsecrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we\ndemonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic\naxioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the\ndata-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis\nstrong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and\nexplain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we\nshow that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the\nwell-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our\ndefinition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data\nreleases."}

One\nstrategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to\njustify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful\nrequests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card\ninformation from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of\n``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign\ncontext being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,\nsuffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the\nrequests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:\nRLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after\nself-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful\nin the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them.

The Model Context\nProtocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such\nresources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute\nwith unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In\nthis paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP\nservers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the\nAndroid permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains\nmalicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a\ndataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access\ncontrol policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%\naccuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats\nin several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces\nnegligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers\nwith a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining\nproductivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions\nfor declarative access control and MCP security."}

A Forensic Framework for Analyzing Self-Hosted Cloud Storage Solutions", "comment": null, "summary": "Self-hosted cloud storage platforms like Nextcloud are gaining popularity\namong individuals and organizations seeking greater control over their data.\nHowever, this shift introduces new challenges for digital forensic\ninvestigations, particularly in systematically analyzing both client and server\ncomponents. Despite Nextcloud's widespread use, it has received limited\nattention in forensic research. In this work, we critically examine existing\ncloud storage forensic frameworks and highlight their limitations. To address\nthe gaps, we propose an extended forensic framework that incorporates device\nmonitoring and leverages cloud APIs for structured, repeatable evidence\nacquisition. Using Nextcloud as a case study, we demonstrate how its native\nAPIs can be used to reliably access forensic artifacts, and we introduce an\nopen-source acquisition tool that implements this approach.

Price manipulation vulnerabilities,\noften via flash loans, are a devastating class of attacks causing significant\nfinancial losses. Existing detection methods are limited. Reactive approaches\nanalyze attacks only after they occur, while proactive static analysis tools\nrely on rigid, predefined heuristics, limiting adaptability. Both depend on\nknown attack patterns, failing to identify novel variants or comprehend complex\neconomic logic. We propose PMDetector, a hybrid framework combining static\nanalysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning to proactively detect\nprice manipulation vulnerabilities. Our approach uses a formal attack model and\na three-stage pipeline. First, static taint analysis identifies potentially\nvulnerable code paths. Second, a two-stage LLM process filters paths by\nanalyzing defenses and then simulates attacks to evaluate exploitability.\nFinally, a static analysis checker validates LLM results, retaining only\nhigh-risk paths and generating comprehensive vulnerability reports. To evaluate\nits effectiveness, we built a dataset of 73 real-world vulnerable and 288\nbenign DeFi protocols. Results show PMDetector achieves 88% precision and 90%\nrecall with Gemini 2.5-flash, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\nstatic analysis and LLM-based approaches. Auditing a vulnerability with\nPMDetector costs just $0.03 and takes 4.0 seconds with GPT-4.1, offering an\nefficient and cost-effective alternative to manual audits."}

The proposed PTMF can be employed in various\nways, including analyzing the activities of threat actors during privacy\nthreats and assessing privacy risks in IoT systems, among others. In this\npaper, we conducted a user study on 12 privacy threats associated with IoT by\ndeveloping a questionnaire based on PTMF and recruited experts from both\nindustry and academia in the fields of security and privacy to gather their\nopinions. The collected data were analyzed and mapped to identify the threat\nactors involved in the identification of IoT users (IU) and the remaining 11\nprivacy threats. Our observation revealed the top three threat actors and the\ncritical paths they used during the IU privacy threat, as well as the remaining\n11 privacy threats.
