Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently proliferated in both size and
complexity. Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing
efficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications.
To address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data
locally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to
collect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated
learning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep
learning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the
data analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with
minimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient
architectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would
be advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a
microservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be
structured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable
entities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated
learning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible,
and extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations
to the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the
privacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an
IoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly
available dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the
proposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images,
comprising 25 malware classes and one benign class. The results showed that our
proposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection and classification performance, with a 99.24%.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have revealed that VLMs, including CLIP, are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, particularly on their visual modality. Traditional methods
for improving adversarial robustness, such as adversarial training, involve
extensive retraining and can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we
propose a new Test-Time defense: Feature Perception Threshold Counterattack
Noise (FPT-Noise), which enhances the adversarial robustness of CLIP without
costly fine-tuning. Our core contributions are threefold: First, we introduce a
Dynamic Feature Modulator that dynamically generate an image-specific and
attack-adaptive noise intensity parameter. Second, We reanalyzed the image
features of CLIP. When images are exposed to different levels of noise, clean
images and adversarial images exhibit distinct rates of feature change. We
established a feature perception threshold to distinguish clean images from
attacked ones. Finally, we integrate a Scene-Aware Regulation guided by a
stability threshold and leverage Test-Time Transformation Ensembling (TTE) to
further mitigate the impact of residual noise and enhance robustness.Extensive
experimentation has demonstrated that FPT-Noise significantly outperforms
existing Test-Time defense methods, boosting average robust accuracy from 0.07%
to 56.86% under AutoAttack while maintaining high performance on clean images
(-1.1%). The code will be made public following the publication of the study.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Operational technology (OT) networks are increasingly coupled with
information technology (IT), expanding the attack surface and complicating
incident response. Although OT standards emphasise incident reporting and
evidence preservation, they do not specify what data to capture during an
incident, which hinders coordination across stakeholders. In contrast, IT
guidance defines reporting content but does not address OT constraints. This
paper presents the Agnostic Incident Reporting (AIR) framework for live OT
incident reporting. AIR comprises 25 elements organised into seven groups to
capture incident context, chronology, impacts, and actions, tailored to
technical, managerial, and regulatory needs. We evaluate AIR by mapping it to
major OT standards, defining activation points for integration and triggering
established OT frameworks, and then retrospectively applying it to the 2015
Ukrainian distribution grid incident. The evaluation indicates that AIR
translates high-level requirements into concrete fields, overlays existing
frameworks without vendor dependence, and can support situational awareness and
communication during response. AIR offers a basis for standardising live OT
incident reporting while supporting technical coordination and regulatory
alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantitative information flow (QIF) is concerned with assessing the leakage
of information in computational systems. In QIF there are two main perspectives
for the quantification of leakage. On one hand, the static perspective
considers all possible runs of the system in the computation of information
flow, and is usually employed when preemptively deciding whether or not to run
the system. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a
specific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all
other runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and
trackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular
run based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the
static perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic
perspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper
we take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:
(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the
adversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on
secrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we
demonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic
axioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the
data-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis
strong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and
explain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we
show that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the
well-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our
definition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data
releases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied
on high-level intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains.
However, real-time defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and
cognitive strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as intrusion
detection system (IDS) logs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer
attacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded
in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases
such as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be
extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays
the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and
cognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to
segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a
highly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely
techniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to
high-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such
as tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to
psychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs
can bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent,
offering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and
landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses
on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within
a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain
conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations.
We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using
the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy,
from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To
conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to
simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework
designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the
potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for
future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

### [7] [Self-Jailbreaking: Language Models Can Reason Themselves Out of Safety Alignment After Benign Reasoning Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20956)

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment
in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking.
Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs
will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One
strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to
justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful
requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card
information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of
``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign
context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,
suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the
requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:
RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after
self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful
in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking,
we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is
sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first
systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path
forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reverse engineering (RE) of x86 binaries is indispensable for malware and
firmware analysis, but remains slow due to stripped metadata and adversarial
obfuscation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for improving RE
efficiency through automated comprehension and commenting, but cloud-hosted,
closed-weight models pose privacy and security risks and cannot be used in
closed-network facilities. We evaluate parameter-efficient fine-tuned local
LLMs for assisting with x86 RE tasks in these settings. Eight open-weight
models across the CodeLlama, Qwen2.5-Coder, and CodeGemma series are fine-tuned
on a custom curated dataset of 5,981 x86 assembly examples. We evaluate them
quantitatively and identify the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B as the top
performer, which we name REx86.
  REx86 reduces test-set cross-entropy loss by 64.2% and improves semantic
cosine similarity against ground truth by 20.3\% over its base model. In a
limited user case study (n=43), REx86 significantly enhanced line-level code
understanding (p = 0.031) and increased the correct-solve rate from 31% to 53%
(p = 0.189), though the latter did not reach statistical significance.
Qualitative analysis shows more accurate, concise comments with fewer
hallucinations.
  REx86 delivers state-of-the-art assistance in x86 RE among local, open-weight
LLMs. Our findings demonstrate the value of domain-specific fine-tuning, and
highlight the need for more commented disassembly data to further enhance LLM
performance in RE. REx86, its dataset, and LoRA adapters are publicly available

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of
increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio
deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly
alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,
without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial
and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass
industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and
Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are
far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering
the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core
research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors
reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and
(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection
without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators
such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic
evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail
under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted
fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding
significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after
fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and
robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental
weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training
protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for tracing and
authenticating text generated by large language models (LLMs). A common
approach to LLM watermarking is to construct a green/red token list and assign
higher or lower generation probabilities to the corresponding tokens,
respectively. However, most existing watermarking algorithms rely on heuristic
green/red token list designs, as directly optimizing the list design with
techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) comes with several challenges.
First, desirable watermarking involves multiple criteria, i.e., detectability,
text quality, robustness against removal attacks, and security against spoofing
attacks. Directly optimizing for these criteria introduces many partially
conflicting reward terms, leading to an unstable convergence process. Second,
the vast action space of green/red token list choices is susceptible to reward
hacking. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end RL framework for robust and
secure LLM watermarking. Our approach adopts an anchoring mechanism for reward
terms to ensure stable training and introduces additional regularization terms
to prevent reward hacking. Experiments on standard benchmarks with two backbone
LLMs show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off across all
criteria, with notable improvements in resistance to spoofing attacks without
degrading other criteria. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems
that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to
prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective
iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our
method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise
agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten,
masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until
the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative
instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By
allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites
may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later
steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not
infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding
non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Blockchain-based Attribute-Based Access Control (BC-ABAC) offers a
decentralized paradigm for secure data governance but faces two inherent
challenges: the transparency of blockchain ledgers threatens user privacy by
enabling reidentification attacks through attribute analysis, while the
computational complexity of policy matching clashes with blockchain's
performance constraints. Existing solutions, such as those employing
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), often incur high overhead and lack measurable
anonymity guarantees, while efficiency optimizations frequently ignore privacy
implications. To address these dual challenges, this paper proposes QAEBAC
(Quantifiable Anonymity and Efficiency in Blockchain-Based Access Control with
Attribute). QAE-BAC introduces a formal (r, t)-anonymity model to dynamically
quantify the re-identification risk of users based on their access attributes
and history. Furthermore, it features an Entropy-Weighted Path Tree (EWPT) that
optimizes policy structure based on realtime anonymity metrics, drastically
reducing policy matching complexity. Implemented and evaluated on Hyperledger
Fabric, QAE-BAC demonstrates a superior balance between privacy and
performance. Experimental results show that it effectively mitigates
re-identification risks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
up to an 11x improvement in throughput and an 87% reduction in latency, proving
its practicality for privacy-sensitive decentralized applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) pose unprecedented dual-use risks
through the potential proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) weapons knowledge. We present the first comprehensive evaluation
of 10 leading commercial LLMs against both a novel 200-prompt CBRN dataset and
a 180-prompt subset of the FORTRESS benchmark, using a rigorous three-tier
attack methodology. Our findings expose critical safety vulnerabilities: Deep
Inception attacks achieve 86.0\% success versus 33.8\% for direct requests,
demonstrating superficial filtering mechanisms; Model safety performance varies
dramatically from 2\% (claude-opus-4) to 96\% (mistral-small-latest) attack
success rates; and eight models exceed 70\% vulnerability when asked to enhance
dangerous material properties. We identify fundamental brittleness in current
safety alignment, where simple prompt engineering techniques bypass safeguards
for dangerous CBRN information. These results challenge industry safety claims
and highlight urgent needs for standardized evaluation frameworks, transparent
safety metrics, and more robust alignment techniques to mitigate catastrophic
misuse risks while preserving beneficial capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite their superior performance on a wide range of domains, large language
models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to misuse for generating harmful content, a
risk that has been further amplified by various jailbreak attacks. Existing
jailbreak attacks mainly follow sequential logic, where LLMs understand and
answer each given task one by one. However, concurrency, a natural extension of
the sequential scenario, has been largely overlooked. In this work, we first
propose a word-level method to enable task concurrency in LLMs, where adjacent
words encode divergent intents. Although LLMs maintain strong utility in
answering concurrent tasks, which is demonstrated by our evaluations on
mathematical and general question-answering benchmarks, we notably observe that
combining a harmful task with a benign one significantly reduces the
probability of it being filtered by the guardrail, showing the potential risks
associated with concurrency in LLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce
$\texttt{JAIL-CON}$, an iterative attack framework that
$\underline{\text{JAIL}}$breaks LLMs via task $\underline{\text{CON}}$currency.
Experiments on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the strong jailbreak capabilities
of $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ compared to existing attacks. Furthermore, when the
guardrail is applied as a defense, compared to the sequential answers generated
by previous attacks, the concurrent answers in our $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ exhibit
greater stealthiness and are less detectable by the guardrail, highlighting the
unique feature of task concurrency in jailbreaking LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly and now encode extensive
world knowledge. Despite safety fine-tuning, however, they remain susceptible
to adversarial prompts that elicit harmful content. Existing jailbreak
techniques fall into two categories: white-box methods (e.g., gradient-based
approaches such as GCG), which require model internals and are infeasible for
closed-source APIs, and black-box methods that rely on attacker LLMs to search
or mutate prompts but often produce templates that lack explainability and
transferability. We introduce TrojFill, a black-box jailbreak that reframes
unsafe instruction as a template-filling task. TrojFill embeds obfuscated
harmful instructions (e.g., via placeholder substitution or Caesar/Base64
encoding) inside a multi-part template that asks the model to (1) reason why
the original instruction is unsafe (unsafety reasoning) and (2) generate a
detailed example of the requested text, followed by a sentence-by-sentence
analysis. The crucial "example" component acts as a Trojan Horse that contains
the target jailbreak content while the surrounding task framing reduces refusal
rates. We evaluate TrojFill on standard jailbreak benchmarks across leading
LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen), showing strong empirical
performance (e.g., 100% attack success on Gemini-flash-2.5 and DeepSeek-3.1,
and 97% on GPT-4o). Moreover, the generated prompts exhibit improved
interpretability and transferability compared with prior black-box optimization
approaches. We release our code, sample prompts, and generated outputs to
support future red-teaming research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) comprise of both visual and textual
modalities to process vision language tasks. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to
security-related issues, such as jailbreak attacks that alter the model's input
to induce unauthorized or harmful responses. The incorporation of the
additional visual modality introduces new dimensions to security threats. In
this paper, we proposed a black-box jailbreak method via both text and image
prompts to evaluate MLLMs. In particular, we designed text prompts with
provocative instructions, along with image prompts that introduced mutation and
multi-image capabilities. To strengthen the evaluation, we also designed a
Re-attack strategy. Empirical results show that our proposed work can improve
capabilities to assess the security of both open-source and closed-source
MLLMs. With that, we identified gaps in existing defense methods to propose new
strategies for both training-time and inference-time defense methods, and
evaluated them across the new jailbreak methods. The experiment results showed
that the re-designed defense methods improved protections against the jailbreak
attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with
external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context
Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such
resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute
with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In
this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP
servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the
Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains
malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a
dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access
control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%
accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats
in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces
negligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers
with a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining
productivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions
for declarative access control and MCP security.

Abstract: Self-hosted cloud storage platforms like Nextcloud are gaining popularity
among individuals and organizations seeking greater control over their data.
However, this shift introduces new challenges for digital forensic
investigations, particularly in systematically analyzing both client and server
components. Despite Nextcloud's widespread use, it has received limited
attention in forensic research. In this work, we critically examine existing
cloud storage forensic frameworks and highlight their limitations. To address
the gaps, we propose an extended forensic framework that incorporates device
monitoring and leverages cloud APIs for structured, repeatable evidence
acquisition. Using Nextcloud as a case study, we demonstrate how its native
APIs can be used to reliably access forensic artifacts, and we introduce an
open-source acquisition tool that implements this approach. Our framework
equips investigators with a more flexible method for analyzing self-hosted
cloud storage systems, and offers a foundation for further development in this
evolving area of digital forensics.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts manage billions of dollars,
making them a prime target for exploits. Price manipulation vulnerabilities,
often via flash loans, are a devastating class of attacks causing significant
financial losses. Existing detection methods are limited. Reactive approaches
analyze attacks only after they occur, while proactive static analysis tools
rely on rigid, predefined heuristics, limiting adaptability. Both depend on
known attack patterns, failing to identify novel variants or comprehend complex
economic logic. We propose PMDetector, a hybrid framework combining static
analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning to proactively detect
price manipulation vulnerabilities. Our approach uses a formal attack model and
a three-stage pipeline. First, static taint analysis identifies potentially
vulnerable code paths. Second, a two-stage LLM process filters paths by
analyzing defenses and then simulates attacks to evaluate exploitability.
Finally, a static analysis checker validates LLM results, retaining only
high-risk paths and generating comprehensive vulnerability reports. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we built a dataset of 73 real-world vulnerable and 288
benign DeFi protocols. Results show PMDetector achieves 88% precision and 90%
recall with Gemini 2.5-flash, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
static analysis and LLM-based approaches. Auditing a vulnerability with
PMDetector costs just $0.03 and takes 4.0 seconds with GPT-4.1, offering an
efficient and cost-effective alternative to manual audits.

Abstract: Authentication systems have evolved a lot since the 1960s when Fernando
Corbato first proposed the password-based authentication. In 2013, the FIDO
Alliance proposed using secure hardware for authentication, thus marking a
milestone in the passwordless authentication era [1]. Passwordless
authentication with a possession-based factor often relied on hardware-backed
cryptographic methods. FIDO2 being one an amalgamation of the W3C Web
Authentication and FIDO Alliance Client to Authenticator Protocol is an
industry standard for secure passwordless authentication with rising adoption
for the same [2]. However, the current FIDO2 standards use ECDSA with SHA-256
(ES256), RSA with SHA-256 (RS256) and similar classical cryptographic signature
algorithms. This makes it insecure against attacks involving large-scale
quantum computers [3]. This study aims at exploring the usability of Module
Lattice based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), based on Crystals Dilithium
as a post quantum cryptographic signature standard for FIDO2. The paper
highlights the performance and security in comparison to keys with classical
algorithms.

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions of dollars annually, yet
existing automated analysis tools fail to generate deployable defenses. We
present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime
guards as Solidity "require" statements to harden smart contracts against
exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic
analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted
large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning
on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our
extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's
effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for
synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000
challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent
matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES
prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract
functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA
incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES
establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate
production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring
vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We
release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to
enable reproducible research in this critical domain.

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

Abstract: We present GRAFHEN, a new cryptographic scheme which offers Fully Homomorphic
Encryption without the need for bootstrapping (or in other words, without
noise). Building on the work of Nuida and others, we achieve this using
encodings in groups.
  The groups are represented on a machine using rewriting systems. In this way
the subgroup membership problem, which an attacker would have to solve in order
to break the scheme, becomes maximally hard, while performance is preserved. In
fact we include a simple benchmark demonstrating that our implementation runs
several orders of magnitude faster than existing standards.
  We review many possible attacks against our protocol and explain how to
protect the scheme in each case.

Abstract: Previous studies on PTA have focused on analyzing privacy threats based on
the potential areas of occurrence and their likelihood of occurrence. However,
an in-depth understanding of the threat actors involved, their actions, and the
intentions that result in privacy threats is essential. In this paper, we
present a novel Privacy Threat Model Framework (PTMF) that analyzes privacy
threats through different phases.
  The PTMF development is motivated through the selected tactics from the MITRE
ATT\&CK framework and techniques from the LINDDUN privacy threat model, making
PTMF a privacy-centered framework. The proposed PTMF can be employed in various
ways, including analyzing the activities of threat actors during privacy
threats and assessing privacy risks in IoT systems, among others. In this
paper, we conducted a user study on 12 privacy threats associated with IoT by
developing a questionnaire based on PTMF and recruited experts from both
industry and academia in the fields of security and privacy to gather their
opinions. The collected data were analyzed and mapped to identify the threat
actors involved in the identification of IoT users (IU) and the remaining 11
privacy threats. Our observation revealed the top three threat actors and the
critical paths they used during the IU privacy threat, as well as the remaining
11 privacy threats. This study could provide a solid foundation for
understanding how and where privacy measures can be proactively and effectively
deployed in IoT systems to mitigate privacy threats based on the activities and
intentions of threat actors within these systems.

Abstract: Large-scale systems that compute analytics over a fleet of devices must
achieve high privacy and security standards while also meeting data quality,
usability, and resource efficiency expectations. We present a next-generation
federated analytics system that uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
based on technologies like AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX to provide verifiable
privacy guarantees for all server-side processing. In our system, devices
encrypt and upload data, tagging it with a limited set of allowable server-side
processing steps. An open source, TEE-hosted key management service guarantees
that the data is accessible only to those steps, which are themselves protected
by TEE confidentiality and integrity assurance guarantees. The system is
designed for flexible workloads, including processing unstructured data with
LLMs (for structured summarization) before aggregation into differentially
private insights (with automatic parameter tuning). The transparency properties
of our system allow any external party to verify that all raw and derived data
is processed in TEEs, protecting it from inspection by the system operator, and
that differential privacy is applied to all released results. This system has
been successfully deployed in production, providing helpful insights into
real-world GenAI experiences.
