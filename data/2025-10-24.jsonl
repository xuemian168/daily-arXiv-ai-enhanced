Prompt injection attacks\ncan cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit\nharmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a\nlocally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are\nevaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a \"defense attorney\"\nmodel argues the prompt is benign, a \"prosecution attorney\" model argues the\nprompt is a prompt injection, and a \"judge\" model gives the final\nclassification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct\nDetector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt\ninjection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the\nimportance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the\nclassification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of\nCourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use\nof multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks.

Our contributions validate the\nfeasibility of low-power, hardware- accelerated HHE for edge deployment and\nprovide a hardware- software co-design methodology for building scalable,\nsecure machine learning systems in resource-constrained environments.\nExperiments on a PYNQ-Z2 platform with the MNIST dataset show over a 50x\nreduction in client-side encryption latency and nearly a 2x gain in hardware\nthroughput compared to existing FPGA-based HHE accelerators."}

These risks could lead to the attacks\nincluding user behavior recognition, sensitive location inference and\ntrajectory reconstruction. In order to mitigate the data security risk caused\nby the automotive location sharing, this paper proposes a high-precision\nprivacy protection mechanism based on format-preserving encryption (FPE) of\ngeographical coordinates. The automotive coordinate data key mapping mechanism\nis designed to reduce to the accuracy loss of the geographical location data\ncaused by the repeated encryption and decryption. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the average relative distance retention rate (RDR) reached\n0.0844, and the number of hotspots in the critical area decreased by 98.9%\nafter encryption. To evaluate the accuracy loss of the proposed encryption\nalgorithm on automotive geographical location data, this paper presents the\nexperimental analysis of decryption accuracy, and the result indicates that the\ndecrypted coordinate data achieves a restoration accuracy of 100%. This work\npresents a high-precision privacy protection method for automotive location\ndata, thereby providing an efficient data security solution for the sensitive\ndata sharing in autonomous driving."}

Especially\nin the face of adversarial attacks, DRL may suffer serious performance\ndegradation or even make potentially dangerous decisions, so it is crucial to\nensure their stability in security-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we first\nintroduce the basic framework of DRL and analyze the main security challenges\nfaced in complex and changing environments. In addition, this paper proposes an\nadversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and\nattack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL\nin detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space,\naction space, reward function and model space. To effectively counter the\nattacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness\ntraining strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training,\nrobust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related\ndefense techniques, we also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these\nmethods in improving the robustness of DRL.

Operating in dynamic\non-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app\ninteractions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector:\nenvironmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual\ninstructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by\ninserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed\nnotifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can\nderail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible\ndevice compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce\nGhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under\nenvironmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving\nbeyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events\ninto realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators\nand evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a\njudge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the\nagent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,\npinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to\ndeceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive\nand reason about manipulated UIs.

It allows them to apply deep learning by fine-tuning\nmodels at a fraction of the cost of training a brand-new model.

Attackers can use model sharing by hiding self-executing\nmalware inside neural network parameters and then distributing them for\nunsuspecting users to unknowingly directly execute them, or indirectly as a\ndependency in another software. In this work, we propose NeuPerm, a simple yet\neffec- tive way of disrupting such malware by leveraging the theoretical\nproperty of neural network permutation symmetry.

The idea is simple: Instead of\nappending an authentication tag to each message in a communication stream, the\nintegrity protection of multiple messages is aggregated into a single tag.\nRecent studies postulate, e.g., based on simulations, that these benefits also\nspread to wireless, and thus lossy, scenarios despite each lost packet\ntypically resulting in the loss of integrity protection information for\nmultiple messages. In this paper, we investigate these claims in a real\ndeployment. Therefore, we first design a MAC aggregation extension for the\nDatagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.3 protocol. Afterward, we\nextensively evaluate the performance of MAC aggregation on a complete\ncommunication protocol stack on embedded hardware. We find that MAC aggregation\ncan indeed increase goodput by up to 50% and save up to 17% of energy\nexpenditure for the transmission of short messages, even in lossy channels."}

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors."}

This is because of its\nincentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.\n  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC\n(NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to\nmitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners;\nhowever, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they\nconsider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the\ntransfer collude with the miner.\n  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by\npresenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and\ngame-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC\nthan He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking\nnaive HTLC.\n  Leveraging our insights, we propose \\prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC\nprotocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \\prot\\ employs a two-phase\napproach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as\nminers. In Phase 1, parties commit to the transfer; in Phase 2, the transfer is\nexecuted without manipulation.
