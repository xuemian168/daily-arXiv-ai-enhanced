Fine-grained Jailbreak Evaluation with Anchored Reference", "comment": "7 pages, 3 figures, preprint", "summary": "Jailbreak attacks present a significant challenge to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current automated evaluation methods largely rely on coarse classifications that focus mainly on harmfulness, leading to substantial overestimation of attack success. To address this problem, we propose FJAR, a fine-grained jailbreak evaluation framework with anchored references. We first categorized jailbreak responses into five fine-grained categories: Rejective, Irrelevant, Unhelpful, Incorrect, and Successful, based on the degree to which the response addresses the malicious intent of the query. This categorization serves as the basis for FJAR. Then, we introduce a novel harmless tree decomposition approach to construct high-quality anchored references by breaking down the original queries. These references guide the evaluator in determining whether the response genuinely fulfills the original query. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FJAR achieves the highest alignment with human judgment and effectively identifies the root causes of jailbreak failures, providing actionable guidance for improving attack strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present TRYLOCK, the first defense-in-depth architecture that combines four heterogeneous mechanisms across the inference stack: weight-level safety alignment via DPO, activation-level control via Representation Engineering (RepE) steering, adaptive steering strength selected by a lightweight sidecar classifier, and input canonicalization to neutralize encoding-based bypasses. On Mistral-7B-Instruct evaluated against a 249-prompt attack set spanning five attack families, TRYLOCK achieves 88.0% relative ASR reduction (46.5% to 5.6%), with each layer contributing unique coverage: RepE blocks 36% of attacks that bypass DPO alone, while canonicalization catches 14% of encoding attacks that evade both. We discover a non-monotonic steering phenomenon -- intermediate strength (alpha=1.0) degrades safety below baseline -- and provide mechanistic hypotheses explaining RepE-DPO interference. The adaptive sidecar reduces over-refusal from 60% to 48% while maintaining identical attack defense, demonstrating that security and usability need not be mutually exclusive.

But there are serious security concerns which are brought about by its distributed and multi-tenant characteristics. The old methods of detecting and reacting to threats which are mostly reliant on fixed signatures, predefined rules and human operators are becoming less and less effective even in the advanced stages of cyberattacks of cloud infrastructures. The recent trend in the field of addressing these limitations is the creation of technologies of artificial intelligence (AI). The strategies allow independent protection, anomaly detection, and real-time analysis with references to using deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. Through imbuing AI with a constantly-learning feature, it enables the intrusion detection system to be more accurate and generate a lesser number of false positives and it also enables the possibility of adaptive and predictive security. The fusion of large-scale language models with efficient orchestration platforms contributes to reacting to the arising threats with a quicker and more precise response. This allows automatic control over incidences, self-healing network, and defense mechanisms on a policy basis. Considering the current detection and response methods, this discussion assesses their strengths and weaknesses and outlines key issues such as data privacy, adversarial machine learning and integration complexity in the context of AI-based cloud security.

DeepLeak advances the state-of-the-art in three ways: (1) comprehensive leakage profiling: we develop a stronger explanation-aware membership inference attack (MIA) to quantify how much representative explanation methods leak membership information under default configurations; (2) lightweight hardening strategies: we introduce practical, model-agnostic mitigations, including sensitivity-calibrated noise, attribution clipping, and masking, that substantially reduce membership leakage while preserving explanation utility; and (3) root-cause analysis: through controlled experiments, we pinpoint algorithmic properties (e.g., attribution sparsity and sensitivity) that drive leakage.\n  Evaluating 15 explanation techniques across four families on image benchmarks, DeepLeak shows that default settings can leak up to 74.9% more membership information than previously reported. Our mitigations cut leakage by up to 95% (minimum 46.5%) with only <=3.3% utility loss on average.

Our analysis reveals a dualistic nature of the parameter l. According to the previous analysis, it does not affect resistance to guessing attacks. A deeper examination of the verification mechanism demonstrates that l establishes a kind of verification barrier of l times m bits. We establish the threshold relationship l less q minus 1 times m, below which parameter l becomes security-critical. The optimal selection rule l near q minus 1 times m is proposed for maximum cryptographic efficiency.

Infrastructure components, cryptographic primitives, certificates, and services are represented as a heterogeneous graph, enabling explicit modeling of dependency-driven risk propagation. PQ exposure is quantified using graph-theoretic risk functionals and attributed across cryptographic domains via Shapley value decomposition.
