By leveraging the\ncomprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns,\nour approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph\nstructural relationships and tem- poral dynamics through sequential analysis of\nnetwork events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of\nimproved model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling\ncybersecurity analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security\nevents - a critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection\nsystems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed\nhybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine\nlearning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple\nevaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The\nmodel achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated\nattack patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial\nof Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising\nsolution for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network\nenvironments."}

However, unauthorized commercial use of\nthese datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset\nowners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer\nfrom inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to\nlabel inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical\ncomplexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential\nwatermark removal attacks."}

While\ncombining these resources is desirable, we empirically demonstrate that naively\nconcatenating them results in a noisy label space that severely degrades model\nperformance. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce CyberNER, a\nlarge-scale, unified corpus created by systematically harmonizing four\nprominent datasets (CyNER, DNRTI, APTNER, and Attacker) onto the STIX 2.1\nstandard. Our principled methodology resolves semantic ambiguities and\nconsolidates over 50 disparate source tags into 21 coherent entity types. Our\nexperiments show that models trained on CyberNER achieve a substantial\nperformance gain, with a relative F1-score improvement of approximately 30%\nover the naive concatenation baseline. By publicly releasing the CyberNER\ncorpus, we provide a crucial, standardized benchmark that enables the creation\nand rigorous comparison of more robust and generalizable entity extraction\nmodels for the cybersecurity domain."}

While these devices offer convenience and\nsafety, they also raise new privacy concerns: how these devices affect others,\nlike neighbors, visitors, or people passing by. This issue is generally known\nas interdependent privacy, where one person's actions (or inaction) may impact\nthe privacy of others, and, specifically, bystander privacy in the context of\nsmart homes. Given lax data protection regulations in terms of shared physical\nspaces and amateur joint data controllers, we expect that the privacy policies\nof smart home products reflect the missing regulatory incentives. This paper\npresents a focused privacy policy analysis of 20 video doorbell and smart\ncamera products, concentrating explicitly on the bystander aspect. We show that\nalthough some of the vendors acknowledge bystanders, they address it only to\nthe extent of including disclaimers, shifting the ethical responsibility for\ncollecting the data of non-users to the device owner. In addition, we identify\nand examine real-world cases related to bystander privacy, demonstrating how\ncurrent deployments can impact non-users. Based on our findings, we analyze\nvendor privacy policies in light of existing legal frameworks and technical\ncapabilities, and we provide practical recommendations for both policy language\nand system design to enhance transparency and empower both bystanders and\ndevice owners."}

In this paper, we propose a\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to\nenhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This\napproach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant\ntext, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise.\nThese two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic\ninformation to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to\ndynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant\nsemantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the\nlegitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's\nperformance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose\nan alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated\niteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the\nencryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method\nachieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak\nsignalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB."}
