By decomposing decisions into weighted, criterion based evaluations, the QOC model enhances transparency, fairness, and explainability in DAO voting. We demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) and stakeholder aligned AI agents can support or automate evaluations, while statistical safeguards help detect manipulation. The proposed framework lays the foundation for scalable and trustworthy governance in the Web3 ecosystem."}

However, since Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models rely heavily on the quality of their training data, the lack of diverse and up-to-date datasets hinders their generalization capability to detect malicious activity in previously unseen network traffic. This study presents an experimental validation of the reliability of the GeNIS dataset for AI-based NIDS, to serve as a baseline for future benchmarks. Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. All models reached high accuracy and F1-scores, and the ML ensembles achieved slightly better generalization while remaining more efficient than DL models. Overall, the obtained results indicate that the GeNIS dataset supports intelligent intrusion detection and cyberattack classification with time-based and quantity-based behavioral features."}

Current cryptographic solutions introduce additional computational overhead, which results in heightened identification delays. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identifies devices at the physical layer, blocking impersonation attacks while significantly reducing latency. Unfortunately, multipath channels compromise RFF accuracy, and existing channel-resilient methods demand feedback or processing across multiple time points, incurring extra signaling latency. To address this problem, the paper introduces a new RFF extraction technique that employs signals from multiple receiving antennas to address multipath issues without adding latency. Unlike single-domain methods, the Log-Linear Delta Ratio (LLDR) of co-temporal channel frequency responses (CFRs) from multiple antennas is employed to preserve discriminative RFF features, eliminating multi-time sampling and reducing acquisition time. To overcome the challenge of the reliance on minimal channel variation, the frequency band is segmented into sub-bands, and the LLDR is computed within each sub-band individually. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme attains a 96.13% identification accuracy for 30 user equipments (UEs) within a 20-path channel under a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB. Furthermore, we evaluate the theoretical latency using the Roofline model, resulting in the air interface latency of 0.491 ms, which satisfies ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) latency requirements."}

As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations."}

However, existing watermarks are easily removed when facing model stealing attacks, and make it difficult for model owners to effectively verify the copyright of stolen models. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of the failure of current watermarking methods under model stealing scenarios and then explore potential solutions. Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in defending against various model stealing attacks, as well as watermark attacks, and achieves new state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness."}

Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners."}

However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes."}

Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance."}

Building on this concept, we present SecTracer as a framework for a network-wide provenance analysis. SecTracer offers three main contributions: (i) comprehensive and efficient forensic data collection in enterprise networks via software-defined networking (SDN), (ii) reconstruction of attack histories through provenance graphs to provide a clear and interpretable view of intrusions, and (iii) proactive attack prediction using probabilistic models.

There are mainly two classes of KLE techniques, cascade encryption and XOR-cascade encryption. This paper presents several quantum meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against two specific KLE constructions.\n  For the two-key triple encryption (2kTE), we propose two quantum MITM attacks under the Q2 model. The first attack, leveraging the quantum claw-finding (QCF) algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{2κ/3})$ with $O(2^{2κ/3})$ quantum random access memory (QRAM). The second attack, based on Grover's algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{κ/2})$ with $O(2^κ)$ QRAM. The latter complexity is nearly identical to Grover-based brute-force attack on the underlying block cipher, indicating that 2kTE does not enhance security under the Q2 model when sufficient QRAM resources are available.\n  For the 3XOR-cascade encryption (3XCE), we propose a quantum MITM attack applicable to the Q1 model. This attack requires no QRAM and has a time complexity of $O(2^{(κ+n)/2})$ ($κ$ and $n$ are the key length and block length of the underlying block cipher, respectively.), achieving a quadratic speedup over classical MITM attack.\n  Furthermore, we extend the quantum MITM attack to quantum sieve-in-the-middle (SITM) attack, which is applicable for more constructions. We present a general quantum SITM framework for the construction $ELE=E^2\\circ L\\circ E^1$ and provide specific attack schemes for three different forms of the middle layer $L$.

To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set.
