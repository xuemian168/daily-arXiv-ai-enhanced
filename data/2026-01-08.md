Abstract: Jailbreak attacks present a significant challenge to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current automated evaluation methods largely rely on coarse classifications that focus mainly on harmfulness, leading to substantial overestimation of attack success. To address this problem, we propose FJAR, a fine-grained jailbreak evaluation framework with anchored references. We first categorized jailbreak responses into five fine-grained categories: Rejective, Irrelevant, Unhelpful, Incorrect, and Successful, based on the degree to which the response addresses the malicious intent of the query. This categorization serves as the basis for FJAR. Then, we introduce a novel harmless tree decomposition approach to construct high-quality anchored references by breaking down the original queries. These references guide the evaluator in determining whether the response genuinely fulfills the original query. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FJAR achieves the highest alignment with human judgment and effectively identifies the root causes of jailbreak failures, providing actionable guidance for improving attack strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and single-layer defenses often trade security for usability. We present TRYLOCK, the first defense-in-depth architecture that combines four heterogeneous mechanisms across the inference stack: weight-level safety alignment via DPO, activation-level control via Representation Engineering (RepE) steering, adaptive steering strength selected by a lightweight sidecar classifier, and input canonicalization to neutralize encoding-based bypasses. On Mistral-7B-Instruct evaluated against a 249-prompt attack set spanning five attack families, TRYLOCK achieves 88.0% relative ASR reduction (46.5% to 5.6%), with each layer contributing unique coverage: RepE blocks 36% of attacks that bypass DPO alone, while canonicalization catches 14% of encoding attacks that evade both. We discover a non-monotonic steering phenomenon -- intermediate strength (alpha=1.0) degrades safety below baseline -- and provide mechanistic hypotheses explaining RepE-DPO interference. The adaptive sidecar reduces over-refusal from 60% to 48% while maintaining identical attack defense, demonstrating that security and usability need not be mutually exclusive. We release all components -- trained adapters, steering vectors, sidecar classifier, preference pairs, and complete evaluation methodology -- enabling full reproducibility.

Abstract: Cloud computing has changed online communities in three dimensions, which are scalability, adaptability and reduced overhead. But there are serious security concerns which are brought about by its distributed and multi-tenant characteristics. The old methods of detecting and reacting to threats which are mostly reliant on fixed signatures, predefined rules and human operators are becoming less and less effective even in the advanced stages of cyberattacks of cloud infrastructures. The recent trend in the field of addressing these limitations is the creation of technologies of artificial intelligence (AI). The strategies allow independent protection, anomaly detection, and real-time analysis with references to using deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. Through imbuing AI with a constantly-learning feature, it enables the intrusion detection system to be more accurate and generate a lesser number of false positives and it also enables the possibility of adaptive and predictive security. The fusion of large-scale language models with efficient orchestration platforms contributes to reacting to the arising threats with a quicker and more precise response. This allows automatic control over incidences, self-healing network, and defense mechanisms on a policy basis. Considering the current detection and response methods, this discussion assesses their strengths and weaknesses and outlines key issues such as data privacy, adversarial machine learning and integration complexity in the context of AI-based cloud security. These results suggest the future application of AI to support autonomous, scalable and active cloud security operations.

Abstract: Advances in generative models and sequence learning have greatly promoted research in dance motion generation, yet current methods still suffer from coarse semantic control and poor coherence in long sequences. In this work, we present Listen to Rhythm, Choose Movements (LRCM), a multimodal-guided diffusion framework supporting both diverse input modalities and autoregressive dance motion generation. We explore a feature decoupling paradigm for dance datasets and generalize it to the Motorica Dance dataset, separating motion capture data, audio rhythm, and professionally annotated global and local text descriptions. Our diffusion architecture integrates an audio-latent Conformer and a text-latent Cross-Conformer, and incorporates a Motion Temporal Mamba Module (MTMM) to enable smooth, long-duration autoregressive synthesis. Experimental results indicate that LRCM delivers strong performance in both functional capability and quantitative metrics, demonstrating notable potential in multimodal input scenarios and extended sequence generation. We will release the full codebase, dataset, and pretrained models publicly upon acceptance.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) explainability is central to algorithmic transparency in high-stakes settings such as predictive diagnostics and loan approval. However, these same domains require rigorous privacy guaranties, creating tension between interpretability and privacy. Although prior work has shown that explanation methods can leak membership information, practitioners still lack systematic guidance on selecting or deploying explanation techniques that balance transparency with privacy.
  We present DeepLeak, a system to audit and mitigate privacy risks in post-hoc explanation methods. DeepLeak advances the state-of-the-art in three ways: (1) comprehensive leakage profiling: we develop a stronger explanation-aware membership inference attack (MIA) to quantify how much representative explanation methods leak membership information under default configurations; (2) lightweight hardening strategies: we introduce practical, model-agnostic mitigations, including sensitivity-calibrated noise, attribution clipping, and masking, that substantially reduce membership leakage while preserving explanation utility; and (3) root-cause analysis: through controlled experiments, we pinpoint algorithmic properties (e.g., attribution sparsity and sensitivity) that drive leakage.
  Evaluating 15 explanation techniques across four families on image benchmarks, DeepLeak shows that default settings can leak up to 74.9% more membership information than previously reported. Our mitigations cut leakage by up to 95% (minimum 46.5%) with only <=3.3% utility loss on average. DeepLeak offers a systematic, reproducible path to safer explainability in privacy-sensitive ML.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cryptographic analysis of the security parameters of the LINEture post-quantum digital signature scheme, which is constructed using matrix algebra over elementary abelian 2-groups. We investigate the influence of three principal parameters. First, the word size m (exhibiting quadratic impact), the second is a vector dimension l, and the third is a number of submatrices in the session key q (exhibiting linear impact) on cryptographic strength. Our analysis reveals a dualistic nature of the parameter l. According to the previous analysis, it does not affect resistance to guessing attacks. A deeper examination of the verification mechanism demonstrates that l establishes a kind of verification barrier of l times m bits. We establish the threshold relationship l less q minus 1 times m, below which parameter l becomes security-critical. The optimal selection rule l near q minus 1 times m is proposed for maximum cryptographic efficiency. Comparative analysis with NIST PQC standards and practical parameter recommendations are provided.

Abstract: The emergence of large-scale quantum computing threatens widely deployed public-key cryptographic systems, creating an urgent need for enterprise-level methods to assess post-quantum (PQ) readiness. While PQ standards are under development, organizations lack scalable and quantitative frameworks for measuring cryptographic exposure and prioritizing migration across complex infrastructures. This paper presents a knowledge graph based framework that models enterprise cryptographic assets, dependencies, and vulnerabilities to compute a unified PQ readiness score. Infrastructure components, cryptographic primitives, certificates, and services are represented as a heterogeneous graph, enabling explicit modeling of dependency-driven risk propagation. PQ exposure is quantified using graph-theoretic risk functionals and attributed across cryptographic domains via Shapley value decomposition. To support scalability and data quality, the framework integrates large language models with human-in-the-loop validation for asset classification and risk attribution. The resulting approach produces explainable, normalized readiness metrics that support continuous monitoring, comparative analysis, and remediation prioritization.

Abstract: This paper critically examines the 2022 Medibank health insurance data breach, which exposed sensitive medical records of 9.7 million individuals due to unencrypted storage, centralized access, and the absence of privacy-preserving analytics. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose an entropy-aware differential privacy (DP) framework that integrates Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with adaptive budget allocation. The design incorporates TLS-encrypted database access, field-level mechanism selection, and smooth sensitivity models to mitigate re-identification risks. Experimental validation was conducted using synthetic Medibank datasets (N = 131,000) with entropy-calibrated DP mechanisms, where high-entropy attributes received stronger noise injection. Results demonstrate a 90.3% reduction in re-identification probability while maintaining analytical utility loss below 24%. The framework further aligns with GDPR Article 32 and Australian Privacy Principle 11.1, ensuring regulatory compliance. By combining rigorous privacy guarantees with practical usability, this work contributes a scalable and technically feasible solution for healthcare data protection, offering a pathway toward resilient, trustworthy, and regulation-ready medical analytics.

Abstract: Disaster response requires sharing heterogeneous artifacts, from tabular assistance records to UAS imagery, under overlapping privacy mandates. Operational systems often reduce compliance to binary access control, which is brittle in time-critical workflows. We present a novel deontic knowledge graph-based framework that integrates a Disaster Management Knowledge Graph (DKG) with a Policy Knowledge Graph (PKG) derived from IoT-Reg and FEMA/DHS privacy drivers. Our release decision function supports three outcomes: Allow, Block, and Allow-with-Transform. The latter binds obligations to transforms and verifies post-transform compliance via provenance-linked derived artifacts; blocked requests are logged as semantic privacy incidents. Evaluation on a 5.1M-triple DKG with 316K images shows exact-match decision correctness, sub-second per-decision latency, and interactive query performance across both single-graph and federated workloads.

Abstract: This paper provides a systematic survey of jailbreak attacks and defenses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), emphasizing that jailbreak vulnerabilities stem from structural factors such as incomplete training data, linguistic ambiguity, and generative uncertainty. It further differentiates between hallucinations and jailbreaks in terms of intent and triggering mechanisms. We propose a three-dimensional survey framework: (1) Attack dimension-including template/encoding-based, in-context learning manipulation, reinforcement/adversarial learning, LLM-assisted and fine-tuned attacks, as well as prompt- and image-level perturbations and agent-based transfer in VLMs; (2) Defense dimension-encompassing prompt-level obfuscation, output evaluation, and model-level alignment or fine-tuning; and (3) Evaluation dimension-covering metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), toxicity score, query/time cost, and multimodal Clean Accuracy and Attribute Success Rate. Compared with prior works, this survey spans the full spectrum from text-only to multimodal settings, consolidating shared mechanisms and proposing unified defense principles: variant-consistency and gradient-sensitivity detection at the perception layer, safety-aware decoding and output review at the generation layer, and adversarially augmented preference alignment at the parameter layer. Additionally, we summarize existing multimodal safety benchmarks and discuss future directions, including automated red teaming, cross-modal collaborative defense, and standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Smart grids are increasingly exposed to sophisticated cyber threats due to their reliance on interconnected communication networks, as demonstrated by real world incidents such as the cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid. In IEC61850 based smart substations, the Manufacturing Message Specification protocol operates over TCP to facilitate communication between SCADA systems and field devices such as Intelligent Electronic Devices and Programmable Logic Controllers. Although MMS enables efficient monitoring and control, it can be exploited by adversaries to generate legitimate looking packets for reconnaissance, unauthorized state reading, and malicious command injection, thereby disrupting grid operations. In this work, we propose a fully automated attack detection and prevention framework for IEC61850 compliant smart substations to counter remote cyberattacks that manipulate process states through compromised PLCs and IEDs. A detailed analysis of the MMS protocol is presented, and critical MMS field value pairs are extracted during both normal SCADA operation and active attack conditions. The proposed framework is validated using seven datasets comprising benign operational scenarios and multiple attack instances, including IEC61850Bean based attacks and script driven attacks leveraging the libiec61850 library. Our approach accurately identifies attack signature carrying MMS packets that attempt to disrupt circuit breaker status, specifically targeting the smart home zone IED and PLC of the EPIC testbed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in precisely detecting malicious MMS traffic and enhancing the cyber resilience of IEC61850 based smart grid environments.

Abstract: Sybil attacks remain a fundamental obstacle in open online systems, where adversaries can cheaply create and sustain large numbers of fake identities. Existing defenses, including CAPTCHAs and one-time proof-of-personhood mechanisms, primarily address identity creation and provide limited protection against long-term, large-scale Sybil participation, especially as automated solvers and AI systems continue to improve.
  We introduce the Human Challenge Oracle (HCO), a new security primitive for continuous, rate-limited human verification. HCO issues short, time-bound challenges that are cryptographically bound to individual identities and must be solved in real time. The core insight underlying HCO is that real-time human cognitive effort, such as perception, attention, and interactive reasoning, constitutes a scarce resource that is inherently difficult to parallelize or amortize across identities.
  We formalize the design goals and security properties of HCO and show that, under explicit and mild assumptions, sustaining s active identities incurs a cost that grows linearly with s in every time window. We further describe abstract classes of admissible challenges and concrete browser-based instantiations, and present an initial empirical study illustrating that these challenges are easily solvable by humans within seconds while remaining difficult for contemporary automated systems under strict time constraints.
