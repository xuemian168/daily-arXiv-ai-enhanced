Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various tasks, but their security vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to generate harmful content, causing adverse impacts across various societal domains. Most existing jailbreak methods revolve around Prompt Engineering or adversarial optimization, yet we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon: many harmful scenarios are highly consistent with legitimate ones in terms of underlying principles. Based on this finding, this paper proposes the Safe2Harm Semantic Isomorphism Attack method, which achieves efficient jailbreaking through four stages: first, rewrite the harmful question into a semantically safe question with similar underlying principles; second, extract the thematic mapping relationship between the two; third, let the LLM generate a detailed response targeting the safe question; finally, reversely rewrite the safe response based on the thematic mapping relationship to obtain harmful output. Experiments on 7 mainstream LLMs and three types of benchmark datasets show that Safe2Harm exhibits strong jailbreaking capability, and its overall performance is superior to existing methods. Additionally, we construct a challenging harmful content evaluation dataset containing 358 samples and evaluate the effectiveness of existing harmful detection methods, which can be deployed for LLM input-output filtering to enable defense.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has grown exponentially in recent years, introducing significant security challenges. Accurate identification of the types of IoT devices and their associated actions through network traffic analysis is essential to mitigate potential threats. By monitoring and analysing packet flows between IoT devices and connected networks, anomalous or malicious behaviours can be detected. Existing research focuses primarily on device identification within local networks using methods such as protocol fingerprinting and wireless frequency scanning. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to monitor or classify IoT devices externally. To address this gap, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), in conjunction with targeted network traffic monitoring to classify IoT device types and their actions. We constructed a testbed comprising an NPAT-enabled router and a diverse set of IoT devices, including smart cameras, controller hubs, home appliances, power controllers, and streaming devices. Experimental results demonstrate that IoT device and action recognition is feasible using our proposed ML-driven approach, with the RF classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 91%, while the MLP recorded the lowest accuracy at 56%. Notably, all device categories were successfully classified except for certain actions associated with security cameras, underscoring both the potential and the limitations of the proposed method.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as unmanned aerial vehicles are vulnerable to slow degradation that develops without causing immediate or obvious failures. Small sensor biases or timing irregularities can accumulate over time, gradually reducing stability while standard monitoring mechanisms continue to report normal operation. Detecting this early phase of degradation remains a challenge, as most existing approaches focus on abrupt faults or visible trajectory deviations. This paper introduces an early warning method based on stability drift, which measures the divergence between predicted and observed state transitions over short horizons. By tracking the gradual growth of this divergence, the proposed approach identifies emerging instability before it becomes visible in the flight trajectory or estimator residuals. The method operates externally to the flight stack and relies only on standard telemetry, making it suitable for deployment without modifying autopilot firmware. The approach was evaluated on a PX4 x500 platform in a software in the loop environment under two realistic degradation scenarios, gradual IMU bias drift and timing irregularities in the control loop. In both cases, the stability drift metric provided a consistent early warning signal several seconds before visible instability appeared, while remaining stable during nominal and aggressive but non degraded flight. The results demonstrate that stability drift can serve as a practical indicator of early degradation in UAV control systems. By providing advance notice during a pre instability phase, the proposed method complements existing safety mechanisms and offers additional time for mitigation or safe mode transitions under slow and subtle attacks.

Abstract: A function inlining optimization is a widely used transformation in modern compilers, which replaces a call site with the callee's body in need. While this transformation improves performance, it significantly impacts static features such as machine instructions and control flow graphs, which are crucial to binary analysis. Yet, despite its broad impact, the security impact of function inlining remains underexplored to date. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of function inlining through the lens of machine learning-based binary analysis. To this end, we dissect the inlining decision pipeline within the LLVM's cost model and explore the combinations of the compiler options that aggressively promote the function inlining ratio beyond standard optimization levels, which we term extreme inlining. We focus on five ML-assisted binary analysis tasks for security, using 20 unique models to systematically evaluate their robustness under extreme inlining scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal several significant findings: i) function inlining, though a benign transformation in intent, can (in)directly affect ML model behaviors, being potentially exploited by evading discriminative or generative ML models; ii) ML models relying on static features can be highly sensitive to inlining; iii) subtle compiler settings can be leveraged to deliberately craft evasive binary variants; and iv) inlining ratios vary substantially across applications and build configurations, undermining assumptions of consistency in training and evaluation of ML models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce UIXPOSE, a source-code-agnostic framework that operates on both compiled and open-source apps. This framework applies Intention Behaviour Alignment (IBA) to mobile malware analysis, aligning UI-inferred intent with runtime semantics. Previous work either infers intent statically, e.g., permission-centric, or widget-level or monitors coarse dynamic signals (endpoints, partial resource usage) that miss content and context. UIXPOSE infers an intent vector from each screen using vision-language models and knowledge structures and combines decoded network payloads, heap/memory signals, and resource utilisation traces into a behaviour vector. Their alignment, calculated at runtime, can both detect misbehaviour and highlight exploration of behaviourally rich paths. In three real-world case studies, UIXPOSE reveals covert exfiltration and hidden background activity that evade metadata-only baselines, demonstrating how IBA improves dynamic detection.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has led to the adoption of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard for discovering and invoking external tools. While this architecture decouples the reasoning engine from tool execution to enhance scalability, it introduces a significant privacy surface: third-party MCP servers, acting as semi-honest intermediaries, can observe detailed tool interaction logs outside the user's trusted boundary. In this paper, we first identify and formalize a novel privacy threat termed Intent Inversion, where a semi-honest MCP server attempts to reconstruct the user's private underlying intent solely by analyzing legitimate tool calls. To systematically assess this vulnerability, we propose IntentMiner, a framework that leverages Hierarchical Information Isolation and Three-Dimensional Semantic Analysis, integrating tool purpose, call statements, and returned results, to accurately infer user intent at the step level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntentMiner achieves a high degree of semantic alignment (over 85%) with original user queries, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. These results highlight the inherent privacy risks in decoupled agent architectures, revealing that seemingly benign tool execution logs can serve as a potent vector for exposing user secrets.

Abstract: The growing sophistication, frequency, and diversity of cyberattacks increasingly exceed the capacity of individual entities to fully understand and counter them. While existing solutions, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms, and Security Operation Center (SOC), play a vital role in mitigating known threats, they often struggle to effectively address emerging and unforeseen attacks. To increase the effectiveness of cyber defense, it is essential to foster greater information sharing between entities; however, this requires addressing the challenge of exchanging sensitive data without compromising confidentiality or operational security.
  To address the challenges of secure and confidential Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing, we propose a novel architecture that federates Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) and leverages concepts from Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) to empower SOCs. This framework enables controlled collaboration and data privacy while enhancing collective defenses. As a proof of concept, we evaluate one module by applying Differential Privacy (DP) to Federated Learning (FL), observing a manageable accuracy drop from 98.42% to 85.98% (average loss 12.44%) while maintaining reliable detection of compromised messages. These results highlight the viability of secure data sharing and establishes a foundation for the future full-scale implementation of LegionITS.

Abstract: WebAssembly (Wasm) has risen as a widely used technology to distribute computing workloads on different platforms. The platform independence offered through Wasm makes it an attractive solution for many different applications that can run on disparate infrastructures. In addition, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are offered in many computing infrastructures, which allows also running security sensitive Wasm workloads independent of the specific platforms offered. However, recent work has shown that Wasm binaries are more sensitive to code confidentiality attacks than native binaries. The previous result was obtained for Intel SGX only. In this paper, we take this one step further, introducing a new Wasm code-confidentiality attack that exploits exposed address-space information in TEEs. Our attack enables the extraction of crucial execution features which, when combined with additional side channels, allows us to with high reliability obtain more than 70% of the code in most cases. This is a considerably larger amount than was previously obtained by single stepping Intel SGX where only upwards to 50% of the code could be obtained.

Abstract: Video recognition systems are increasingly being deployed in daily life, such as content recommendation and security monitoring. To enhance video recognition development, many institutions have released high-quality public datasets with open-source licenses for training advanced models. At the same time, these datasets are also susceptible to misuse and infringement. Dataset copyright auditing is an effective solution to identify such unauthorized use. However, existing dataset copyright solutions primarily focus on the image domain; the complex nature of video data leaves dataset copyright auditing in the video domain unexplored. Specifically, video data introduces an additional temporal dimension, which poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and stealthiness of existing methods.
  In this paper, we propose VICTOR, the first dataset copyright auditing approach for video recognition systems. We develop a general and stealthy sample modification strategy that enhances the output discrepancy of the target model. By modifying only a small proportion of samples (e.g., 1%), VICTOR amplifies the impact of published modified samples on the prediction behavior of the target models. Then, the difference in the model's behavior for published modified and unpublished original samples can serve as a key basis for dataset auditing. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets highlight the superiority of VICTOR. Finally, we show that VICTOR is robust in the presence of several perturbation mechanisms to the training videos or the target models.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents relying on external retrieval are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments. While existing adversarial attacks primarily focus on content falsification or instruction injection, we identify a novel, process-oriented attack surface: the agent's reasoning style. We propose Reasoning-Style Poisoning (RSP), a paradigm that manipulates how agents process information rather than what they process. We introduce Generative Style Injection (GSI), an attack method that rewrites retrieved documents into pathological tones--specifically "analysis paralysis" or "cognitive haste"--without altering underlying facts or using explicit triggers. To quantify these shifts, we develop the Reasoning Style Vector (RSV), a metric tracking Verification depth, Self-confidence, and Attention focus. Experiments on HotpotQA and FEVER using ReAct, Reflection, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) architectures reveal that GSI significantly degrades performance. It increases reasoning steps by up to 4.4 times or induces premature errors, successfully bypassing state-of-the-art content filters. Finally, we propose RSP-M, a lightweight runtime monitor that calculates RSV metrics in real-time and triggers alerts when values exceed safety thresholds. Our work demonstrates that reasoning style is a distinct, exploitable vulnerability, necessitating process-level defenses beyond static content analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Causal inference plays a crucial role in scientific research across multiple disciplines. Estimating causal effects, particularly the average treatment effect (ATE), from observational data has garnered significant attention. However, computing the ATE from real-world observational data poses substantial privacy risks to users. Differential privacy, which offers strict theoretical guarantees, has emerged as a standard approach for privacy-preserving data analysis. However, existing differentially private ATE estimation works rely on specific assumptions, provide limited privacy protection, or fail to offer comprehensive information protection.
  To this end, we introduce PrivATE, a practical ATE estimation framework that ensures differential privacy. In fact, various scenarios require varying levels of privacy protection. For example, only test scores are generally sensitive information in education evaluation, while all types of medical record data are usually private. To accommodate different privacy requirements, we design two levels (i.e., label-level and sample-level) of privacy protection in PrivATE. By deriving an adaptive matching limit, PrivATE effectively balances noise-induced error and matching error, leading to a more accurate estimate of ATE. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of PrivATE. PrivATE outperforms the baselines on all datasets and privacy budgets.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by extensive datasets that may contain sensitive information, raising serious privacy concerns. One notable threat is the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), where adversaries infer whether a specific sample was used in model training. However, the true impact of MIA on LLMs remains unclear due to inconsistent findings and the lack of standardized evaluation methods, further complicated by the undisclosed nature of many LLM training sets. To address these limitations, we propose PerProb, a unified, label-free framework for indirectly assessing LLM memorization vulnerabilities. PerProb evaluates changes in perplexity and average log probability between data generated by victim and adversary models, enabling an indirect estimation of training-induced memory. Compared with prior MIA methods that rely on member/non-member labels or internal access, PerProb is independent of model and task, and applicable in both black-box and white-box settings. Through a systematic classification of MIA into four attack patterns, we evaluate PerProb's effectiveness across five datasets, revealing varying memory behaviors and privacy risks among LLMs. Additionally, we assess mitigation strategies, including knowledge distillation, early stopping, and differential privacy, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing data leakage. Our findings offer a practical and generalizable framework for evaluating and improving LLM privacy.
