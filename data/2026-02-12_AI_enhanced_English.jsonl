This paper shows that this assumption does not always hold: when FDIA scenarios produce manipulated measurements that remain on the measurement manifold induced by AC power flow relations and measurement redundancy, residual-based detectors may fail to distinguish them from nominal data. The resulting detectability limitation is a property of the measurement manifold itself and does not depend on the attacker's detailed knowledge of the physical system model. To make this limitation observable in practice, we present a data-driven constructive mechanism that incorporates the generic functional structure of AC power flow to generate physically consistent, manifold-constrained perturbations, providing a concrete witness of how residual-based detectors can be bypassed.

Provenance standards like C2PA adopt signed manifests and Merkle-based fragment validation, yet their bindings target encoded assets and break under re-encoding or routine processing.\n  We propose MerkleSpeech, a system for public-key verifiable, chunk-localised speech provenance offering two tiers of assurance. The first, a robust watermark attribution layer (WM-only), survives common distribution transforms and answers \"was this chunk issued by a known party?\". The second, a strict cryptographic integrity layer (MSv1), verifies Merkle inclusion of the chunk's fingerprint under an issuer signature. The system computes perceptual fingerprints over short speech chunks, commits them in a Merkle tree whose root is signed with an issuer key, and embeds a compact in-band watermark payload carrying a random content identifier and chunk metadata sufficient to retrieve Merkle inclusion proofs from a repository. Once the payload is extracted, all subsequent verification steps (signature check, fingerprint recomputation, Merkle inclusion) use only public information. The result is a splice-aware timeline indicating which regions pass each tier and why any given region fails.

Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees. Evaluation against representative attacks spanning 6 exhaustive categories achieves 100% detection with zero false positives and nominal overhead.

Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control.\n  We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA).

In this study, we conducted a comparative static analysis of Android mobile games to investigate privacy and security risks beyond permission usage. The analysis follows a three-phase methodology comprising (i) designing study protocol, (ii) Android Package Kit (APK) collection and static inspection, and (iii) data analysis.

The results showed that while children-oriented games often request fewer permissions, they frequently exhibit configuration-level risks and embed third-party tracking SDKs similar to general-audience games.

Current implementations predominantly rely on a \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains.

We formally define CVPL under an explicit threat model and introduce threshold-aware risk surfaces, R(lambda, tau), that capture the joint effects of protection strength and attacker strictness. We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds.
