In this paper,\nwe introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic\nannotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to\nreplace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges:\nextracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain\ntransaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger\nimplements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor,\na multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer,\nforming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack\n(with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100%\naccuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90%\ncoverage in explanation generation.

Prior\ntechnical work has primarily focused on measuring BMAs, offering little in the\nway of generic defenses.\n  To address this gap, we introduce Pixel Patrol 3D (PP3D), the first\nend-to-end browser framework for discovering, detecting, and defending against\nbehavior-manipulating SE attacks in real time. PP3D consists of a visual\ndetection model implemented within a browser extension, which deploys the model\nclient-side to protect users across desktop and mobile devices while preserving\nprivacy.\n  Our evaluation shows that PP3D can achieve above 99% detection rate at 1%\nfalse positives, while maintaining good latency and overhead performance across\ndevices. Even when faced with new BMA samples collected months after training\nthe detection model, our defense system can still achieve above 97% detection\nrate at 1% false positives.

To investigate this paradox, we\nconstruct a scenario-game dataset spanning 3 macro scenes and 19 sub-scenes,\nand run extensive closed-loop interactions with trust explicitly parameterized.\nUsing Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) as the safety baseline, we propose\ntwo unified metrics: Over-Exposure Rate (OER) to detect boundary violations,\nand Authorization Drift (AD) to capture sensitivity to trust levels.

Using a benchmark dataset from\nthe literature, we demonstrate that SecretLoc detects secrets missed by regex-,\nstatic-, and ML-based methods, including previously unseen types of secrets.
