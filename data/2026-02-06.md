Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSTab-024E.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study privacy amplification by synthetic data release, a phenomenon in which differential privacy guarantees are improved by releasing only synthetic data rather than the private generative model itself. Recent work by Pierquin et al. (2025) established the first formal amplification guarantees for a linear generator, but they apply only in asymptotic regimes where the model dimension far exceeds the number of released synthetic records, limiting their practical relevance. In this work, we show a surprising result: under a bounded-parameter assumption, privacy amplification persists even when releasing an unbounded number of synthetic records, thereby improving upon the bounds of Pierquin et al. (2025). Our analysis provides structural insights that may guide the development of tighter privacy guarantees for more complex release mechanisms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely adopted for their strong generative capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks typically rely on fixed textual triggers and single-entity backdoor targets, making them highly susceptible to enumeration-based input defenses and attention-consistency detection. In this work, we propose Semantic-level Backdoor Attack (SemBD), which implants backdoors at the representation level by defining triggers as continuous semantic regions rather than discrete textual patterns. Concretely, SemBD injects semantic backdoors by distillation-based editing of the key and value projection matrices in cross-attention layers, enabling diverse prompts with identical semantic compositions to reliably activate the backdoor attack. To further enhance stealthiness, SemBD incorporates a semantic regularization to prevent unintended activation under incomplete semantics, as well as multi-entity backdoor targets that avoid highly consistent cross-attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemBD achieves a 100% attack success rate while maintaining strong robustness against state-of-the-art input-level defenses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a data poisoning attack -- Phantom Transfer -- with the property that, even if you know precisely how the poison was placed into an otherwise benign dataset, you cannot filter it out. We achieve this by modifying subliminal learning to work in real-world contexts and demonstrate that the attack works across models, including GPT-4.1. Indeed, even fully paraphrasing every sample in the dataset using a different model does not stop the attack. We also discuss connections to steering vectors and show that one can plant password-triggered behaviours into models while still beating defences.
  This suggests that data-level defences are insufficient for stopping sophisticated data poisoning attacks. We suggest that future work should focus on model audits and white-box security methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems introduce complex privacy risks throughout their lifecycle, especially when processing sensitive or high-dimensional data. Beyond the seven traditional privacy threat categories defined by the LINDDUN framework, AI systems are also exposed to model-centric privacy attacks such as membership inference and model inversion, which LINDDUN does not cover. To address both classical LINDDUN threats and additional AI-driven privacy attacks, PriMod4AI introduces a hybrid privacy threat modeling approach that unifies two structured knowledge sources, a LINDDUN knowledge base representing the established taxonomy, and a model-centric privacy attack knowledge base capturing threats outside LINDDUN. These knowledge bases are embedded into a vector database for semantic retrieval and combined with system level metadata derived from Data Flow Diagram. PriMod4AI uses retrieval-augmented and Data Flow specific prompt generation to guide large language models (LLMs) in identifying, explaining, and categorizing privacy threats across lifecycle stages. The framework produces justified and taxonomy-grounded threat assessments that integrate both classical and AI-driven perspectives. Evaluation on two AI systems indicates that PriMod4AI provides broad coverage of classical privacy categories while additionally identifying model-centric privacy threats. The framework produces consistent, knowledge-grounded outputs across LLMs, as reflected in agreement scores in the observed range.

Abstract: Future AI deployments will likely be monitored for malicious behaviour. The ability of these AIs to subvert monitors by adversarially selecting against them - attack selection - is particularly concerning. To study this, we let a red team create attack policies that attempt to insert attacks into code without being caught by a monitor in the concentrated BigCodeBench backdooring setting. We decompose attack selection into two problems: mapping attacks to a quality score and mapping quality scores to submission probabilities. We frame attack selection as a classification problem and show that safety is significantly more sensitive to FPR than TPR. We find that prompting the attacker model to reason about the monitor while being cautious with attack selection reduces safety from a baseline of 99% to 59% at 0.5% auditing budget, emphasizing that eliciting attack selection capabilities of models is vital to avoid overly optimistic safety scores in control evaluations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI systems has collapsed the credibility landscape for photographic evidence. Modern image generation models produce photorealistic images undermining the evidentiary foundation upon which journalism and public discourse depend. Existing authentication approaches, such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), embed cryptographically signed metadata directly into image files but suffer from two critical failures: technical vulnerability to metadata stripping during social media reprocessing, and structural dependency on corporate-controlled verification infrastructure where commercial incentives may conflict with public interest. We present the Birthmark Standard, an authentication architecture leveraging manufacturing-unique sensor entropy from non-uniformity correction (NUC) maps and PRNU patterns to generate hardware-rooted authentication keys. During capture, cameras create anonymized authentication certificates proving sensor authenticity without exposing device identity via a key table architecture maintaining anonymity sets exceeding 1,000 devices. Authentication records are stored on a consortium blockchain operated by journalism organizations rather than commercial platforms, enabling verification that survives all metadata loss. We formally verify privacy properties using ProVerif, proving observational equivalence for Manufacturer Non-Correlation and Blockchain Observer Non-Identification under Dolev-Yao adversary assumptions. The architecture is validated through prototype implementation using Raspberry Pi 4 hardware, demonstrating the complete cryptographic pipeline. Performance analysis projects camera overhead below 100ms and verification latency below 500ms at scale of one million daily authentications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The landscape of synthetic media has been irrevocably altered by text-to-video (T2V) models, whose outputs are rapidly approaching indistinguishability from reality. Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review].

Abstract: As RISC-V adoption accelerates, domains such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial control are attracting growing attention. These domains are subject to stringent Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) constraints, which have driven a shift toward heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) integrating general-purpose CPUs, tightly coupled accelerators, and diverse I/O devices with different integrity levels. While such integration improves cost efficiency and performance, it introduces a fundamental safety and security challenge: enforcing system-level isolation in mixed-criticality environments. Although RISC-V International has proposed several hardware isolation primitives, including RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, and SmMTT, their interoperability, scalability, and suitability for real-time systems remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of these primitives from the perspective of practical heterogeneous SoC designs. We implement an IOPMP, a World-based checker, and a modified RISC-V World checker that addresses key limitations of the baseline specification, and evaluate their trade-offs in terms of security guarantees and power-performance-area (PPA). Our results show that the World-based checker introduces a fixed, configuration-independent access latency, achieving lower worst-case delay than the evaluated alternatives while scaling predictably with system size. At the macro level, we estimate that the proposed modifications reduce SoC area by up to approximately 5% compared to a baseline design. All artifacts will be released as open source, and we expect these findings to directly contribute to the evolution and ratification of RISC-V specifications, as well as to the design of future RISC-V SoCs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.

Abstract: Online scams across email, short message services, and social media increasingly challenge everyday risk assessment, particularly as generative AI enables more fluent and context-aware deception. Although transformer-based detectors achieve strong predictive performance, their explanations are often opaque to non-experts or misaligned with model decisions. We propose VEXA, an evidence-grounded and persona-adaptive framework for generating learner-facing scam explanations by integrating GradientSHAP-based attribution with theory-informed vulnerability personas. Evaluation across multi-channel datasets shows that grounding explanations in detector-derived evidence improves semantic reliability without increasing linguistic complexity, while persona conditioning introduces interpretable stylistic variation without disrupting evidential alignment. These results reveal a key design insight: evidential grounding governs semantic correctness, whereas persona-based adaptation operates at the level of presentation under constraints of faithfulness. Together, VEXA demonstrates the feasibility of persona-adaptive, evidence-grounded explanations and provides design guidance for trustworthy, learner-facing security explanations in non-formal contexts.

Abstract: As AI agents automate critical workloads, they remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Current defenses rely on monitoring protocols that jointly evaluate an agent's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool-use actions to ensure alignment with user intent. We demonstrate that these monitoring-based defenses can be bypassed via a novel Agent-as-a-Proxy attack, where prompt injection attacks treat the agent as a delivery mechanism, bypassing both agent and monitor simultaneously. While prior work on scalable oversight has focused on whether small monitors can supervise large agents, we show that even frontier-scale monitors are vulnerable. Large-scale monitoring models like Qwen2.5-72B can be bypassed by agents with similar capabilities, such as GPT-4o mini and Llama-3.1-70B. On the AgentDojo benchmark, we achieve a high attack success rate against AlignmentCheck and Extract-and-Evaluate monitors under diverse monitoring LLMs. Our findings suggest current monitoring-based agentic defenses are fundamentally fragile regardless of model scale.

Abstract: Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.

Abstract: Crypto-assets are a main segment of electronic markets, with growing trade volume and market share, yet there's no unified and comprehensive asset level taxonomy framework. This paper develops a multidimensional taxonomy for crypto-assets that connects technical design to market structure and regulation. Building on established taxonomy guideline and existing models, we derive dimensions from theory, regulatory frameworks, and case studies. We then map top 100 assets within the structure and provide several detailed case studies. The taxonomy covers technology standard, centralisation of critical resources, asset function, legal classification and mechanism designs of minting, yield, redemption. The asset mapping and case studies reveal recurring design patterns, capture features of edge cases that sit on boundaries of current categorisations, and document centralised control of nominal decentralised assets. This paper provides framework for systematic study for crypto markets, supports regulators in assessing token risks, and offers investors and digital platform designers a tool to compare assets when building or participate in electronic markets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cyber attacks have become a serious threat to the security of software systems. Many organizations have built their security knowledge bases to safeguard against attacks and vulnerabilities. However, due to the time lag in the official release of security information, these security knowledge bases may not be well maintained, and using them to protect software systems against emergent security risks can be challenging. On the other hand, the security posts on online knowledge-sharing platforms contain many crowd security discussions and the knowledge in those posts can be used to enhance the security knowledge bases. This paper proposes SynAT, an automatic approach to synthesize attack trees from crowd security posts. Given a security post, SynAT first utilize the Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt learning to restrict the scope of sentences that may contain attack information; then it utilizes a transition-based event and relation extraction model to extract the events and relations simultaneously from the scope; finally, it applies heuristic rules to synthesize the attack trees with the extracted events and relations. An experimental evaluation is conducted on 5,070 Stack Overflow security posts, and the results show that SynAT outperforms all baselines in both event and relation extraction, and achieves the highest tree similarity in attack tree synthesis. Furthermore, SynAT has been applied to enhance HUAWEI's security knowledge base as well as public security knowledge bases CVE and CAPEC, which demonstrates SynAT's practicality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, their real-world applicability has expanded significantly, accompanied by new security challenges. Most existing agent defense mechanisms adopt a mandatory checking paradigm, in which security validation is forcibly triggered at predefined stages of the agent lifecycle. In this work, we argue that effective agent security should be intrinsic and selective rather than architecturally decoupled and mandatory. We propose Spider-Sense framework, an event-driven defense framework based on Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS), which allows agents to maintain latent vigilance and trigger defenses only upon risk perception. Once triggered, the Spider-Sense invokes a hierarchical defence mechanism that trades off efficiency and precision: it resolves known patterns via lightweight similarity matching while escalating ambiguous cases to deep internal reasoning, thereby eliminating reliance on external models. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce S$^2$Bench, a lifecycle-aware benchmark featuring realistic tool execution and multi-stage attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spider-Sense achieves competitive or superior defense performance, attaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), with only a marginal latency overhead of 8.3\%.

Abstract: Chat template is a common technique used in the training and inference stages of Large Language Models (LLMs). It can transform input and output data into role-based and templated expressions to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, this also creates a breeding ground for novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we first reveal that the customizability of chat templates allows an attacker who controls the template to inject arbitrary strings into the system prompt without the user's notice. Building on this, we propose a training-free backdoor attack, termed BadTemplate. Specifically, BadTemplate inserts carefully crafted malicious instructions into the high-priority system prompt, thereby causing the target LLM to exhibit persistent backdoor behaviors. BadTemplate outperforms traditional backdoor attacks by embedding malicious instructions directly into the system prompt, eliminating the need for model retraining while achieving high attack effectiveness with minimal cost. Furthermore, its simplicity and scalability make it easily and widely deployed in real-world systems, raising serious risks of rapid propagation, economic damage, and large-scale misinformation. Furthermore, detection by major third-party platforms HuggingFace and LLM-as-a-judge proves largely ineffective against BadTemplate. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 benchmark datasets across 6 open-source and 3 closed-source LLMs, compared with 3 baselines, demonstrate that BadTemplate achieves up to a 100% attack success rate and significantly outperforms traditional prompt-based backdoors in both word-level and sentence-level attacks. Our work highlights the potential security risks raised by chat templates in the LLM supply chain, thereby supporting the development of effective defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite the advantages of decentralization and immutability, blockchain technology faces significant scalability and throughput limitations, which has prompted the exploration of off-chain solutions like payment channels. Adaptor signatures have been considered a promising primitive for constructing such channels due to their support for atomicity, offering an alternative to traditional hash-timelock contracts. However, standard adaptor signatures may reveal signer identity, raising potential privacy concerns. While ring signatures can mitigate this issue by providing anonymity, they often introduce high communication overhead, particularly in multi-account payment settings commonly used in UTXO-based blockchains like Monero. To address these limitations, we propose a Linkable Threshold Ring Adaptor Signature (LTRAS) scheme, which integrates the conditional binding of adaptor signatures, the multi-account payment of threshold ring signatures, and the linkability for preventing double-spending. The formal definition, security model and concrete construction of LTRAS are provided. We also analyze its security and evaluate its performance through theoretical analysis and experimental implementation. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieve significantly lower computation and communication overhead compared to existing schemes in large ring sizes and multi-account payment scenarios. Finally, we discuss its application in cross-chain atomic swaps, demonstrating its potential for enhancing privacy and efficiency in blockchain transactions.

Abstract: Phishing sites continue to grow in volume and sophistication. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze URLs, HTML, and rendered content to decide whether a website is a phishing site. While these approaches are promising, LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection (PI). Because attackers can fully control various elements of phishing sites, this creates the potential for PI that exploits the perceptual asymmetry between LLMs and humans: instructions imperceptible to end users can still be parsed by the LLM and can stealthily manipulate its judgment. The specific risks of PI in phishing detection and effective mitigation strategies remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of PI against multimodal LLM-based phishing detection. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy, defined by Attack Techniques and Attack Surfaces, that captures realistic PI strategies. Using this taxonomy, we implement diverse attacks and empirically study several representative LLM-based detection systems. The results show that phishing detection with state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 remains vulnerable to PI. We then propose InjectDefuser, a defense framework that combines prompt hardening, allowlist-based retrieval augmentation, and output validation. Across multiple models, InjectDefuser significantly reduces attack success rates. Our findings clarify the PI risk landscape and offer practical defenses that improve the reliability of next-generation phishing countermeasures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: GNSSs are vulnerable to attacks of two kinds: jamming (i.e. denying access to the signal) and spoofing (i.e. impersonating a legitimate satellite). These attacks have been extensively studied, and we have a myriad of countermeasures to mitigate them. In this paper we expose a new type of attack: SpAmming, which combines both approaches to achieve the same effects in a more subtle way.
  Exploiting the CDMA multiplexing present in most GNSSs, and through a spoofing attack, this approach leads the receiver to lose access to the signal of a legitimate satellite, which would be equivalent to a denial of service; but in this case the existing countermeasures against jamming or spoofing would not allow safeguarding its effectiveness, as it is neither of them.
  An experimental proof-of-concept is presented in which its impact is evaluated as a function of the previous state of the receiver. Using an SDR-based system developed at the Space Security Centre, the attack is executed against a cold-started receiver, a warm-started receiver, and a receiver that has already acquired the PVT solution and is navigating. Different attack configurations are also tested, starting from a raw emission of the false signal, to surgical Doppler effect configuration, code offset, etc. Although it is shown to be particularly successful against cold-started receivers, the results show that it is also effective in other scenarios, especially if accompanied by other attacks. We will conclude the article by outlining possible countermeasures to detect and, eventually, counteract it; and possible avenues of research to better understand its impact, especially for authenticated services such as OSNMA, and to characterize it in order to improve the response to similar attacks.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have progressively shifted from signature-based techniques toward machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of encryption has reduced payload visibility, weakening inspection pipelines that depend on plaintext content and increasing reliance on flow-level telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX. Many current learning-based detectors still frame intrusion detection as per-flow classification, implicitly treating each flow record as an independent sample. This assumption is often violated in realistic attack campaigns, where evidence is distributed across multiple flows and hosts, spanning minutes to days through staged execution, beaconing, lateral movement, and exfiltration. This paper synthesizes recent research on context-aware deep learning for flow-based intrusion detection. We organize existing methods into a four-dimensional taxonomy covering temporal context, graph or relational context, multimodal context, and multi-resolution context. Beyond modeling, we emphasize rigorous evaluation and operational realism. We review common failure modes that can inflate reported results, including temporal leakage, data splitting, dataset design flaws, limited dataset diversity, and weak cross-dataset generalization. We also analyze practical constraints that shape deployability, such as streaming state management, memory growth, latency budgets, and model compression choices. Overall, the literature suggests that context can meaningfully improve detection when attacks induce measurable temporal or relational structure, but the magnitude and reliability of these gains depend strongly on rigorous, causal evaluation and on datasets that capture realistic diversity.

Abstract: Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) integrates the privacy advantages of distributed training with the capability of self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data, showing strong potential across applications. However, recent studies have shown that FSSL is also vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks are limited by their trigger design, which typically employs a global, uniform trigger that is easily detected, gets diluted during aggregation, and lacks robustness in heterogeneous client environments. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Driven multi-party Collusion Attack (ADCA). During local pre-training, malicious clients decompose the global trigger to find optimal local patterns. Subsequently, these malicious clients collude to form a malicious coalition and establish a collaborative optimization mechanism within it. In this mechanism, each submits its model updates, and an attention mechanism dynamically aggregates them to explore the best cooperative strategy. The resulting aggregated parameters serve as the initial state for the next round of training within the coalition, thereby effectively mitigating the dilution of backdoor information by benign updates. Experiments on multiple FSSL scenarios and four datasets show that ADCA significantly outperforms existing methods in Attack Success Rate (ASR) and persistence, proving its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Lightweight cryptography is becoming essential as emerging technologies in digital identity systems and Internet of Things verification continue to demand strong cryptographic assurance on devices with limited processing power, memory, and energy resources. As these technologies move into routine use, they demand cryptographic primitives that maintain strong security and deliver predictable performance through clear theoretical models of time complexity. Although NIST's lightweight cryptography project provides empirical evaluations of the ten finalist algorithms, a unified theoretical understanding of their time-complexity behavior remains absent. This work introduces a symbolic model that decomposes each scheme into initialization, data-processing, and finalization phases, enabling formal time-complexity derivation for all ten finalists. The results clarify how design parameters shape computational scaling on constrained mobile and embedded environments. The framework provides a foundation needed to distinguish algorithmic efficiency and guides the choice of primitives capable of supporting security systems in constrained environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.

Abstract: Data is the lifeblood of AI, yet much of the most valuable data remains locked in silos due to privacy and regulations. As a result, AI remains heavily underutilized in many of the most important domains, including healthcare, education, and finance. Synthetic data generation (SDG), i.e. the generation of artificial data with a synthesizer trained on real data, offers an appealing solution to make data available while mitigating privacy concerns, however existing SDG-as-a-service workflow require data holders to trust providers with access to private data.We propose FHAIM, the first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) framework for training a marginal-based synthetic data generator on encrypted tabular data. FHAIM adapts the widely used AIM algorithm to the FHE setting using novel FHE protocols, ensuring that the private data remains encrypted throughout and is released only with differential privacy guarantees. Our empirical analysis show that FHAIM preserves the performance of AIM while maintaining feasible runtimes.

Abstract: Existing literature heavily relies on static analysis tools to evaluate LLMs for secure code generation and vulnerability detection. We reviewed 1,080 LLM-generated code samples, built a human-validated ground-truth, and compared the outputs of two widely used static security tools, CodeQL and Semgrep, against this corpus. While 61% of the samples were genuinely secure, Semgrep and CodeQL classified 60% and 80% as secure, respectively. Despite the apparent agreement in aggregate statistics, per-sample analysis reveals substantial discrepancies: only 65% of Semgrep's and 61% of CodeQL's reports correctly matched the ground truth. These results question the reliability of static analysis tools as sole evaluators of code security and underscore the need for expert feedback. Building on this insight, we propose a conceptual framework that persistently stores human feedback in a dynamic retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, enabling LLMs to reuse past feedback for secure code generation and vulnerability detection.

Abstract: GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) have become a central component of open-source vulnerability disclosure and are widely used by developers and security tools. A distinctive feature of GHSA is that only a fraction of advisories are reviewed by GitHub, while the mechanisms associated with this review process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of GHSA review processes, analyzing over 288,000 advisories spanning 2019--2025. We characterize which advisories are more likely to be reviewed, quantify review delays, and identify two distinct review-latency regimes: a fast path dominated by GitHub Repository Advisories (GRAs) and a slow path dominated by NVD-first advisories. We further develop a queueing model that accounts for this dichotomy based on the structure of the advisory processing pipeline.
