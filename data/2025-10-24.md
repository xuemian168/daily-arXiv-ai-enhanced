Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into various sensitive
applications, prompt injection, the use of prompting to induce harmful
behaviors from LLMs, poses an ever increasing risk. Prompt injection attacks
can cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit
harmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a
locally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are
evaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a "defense attorney"
model argues the prompt is benign, a "prosecution attorney" model argues the
prompt is a prompt injection, and a "judge" model gives the final
classification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct
Detector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt
injection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the
importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the
classification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of
CourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use
of multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks. The
implementations of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for
Gemma-3-12b-it, Llama-3.3-8B, and Phi-4-mini-instruct are available at
https://github.com/isaacwu2000/CourtGuard.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that misaligned models may exhibit deceptive
behavior, raising concerns about output trustworthiness. Chain-of-thought (CoT)
is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their
reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before
undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate
their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading
detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we
develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT
obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT
(prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments
in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and
efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation
pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading
detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their
external CoT (under prompt pressure). These results suggest that while CoT
provides valuable oversight in benign settings, robust deployment requires
model-specific stress-testing of monitorability.

Abstract: In recent years, blockchain has experienced widespread adoption across
various industries, becoming integral to numerous enterprise applications.
Concurrently, the rise of generative AI and LLMs has transformed human-computer
interactions, offering advanced capabilities in understanding and generating
human-like text. The introduction of the MCP has further enhanced AI
integration by standardizing communication between AI systems and external data
sources. Despite these advancements, there is still no standardized method for
seamlessly integrating LLM applications and blockchain. To address this
concern, we propose "MCC: Model Context Contracts" a novel framework that
enables LLMs to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts through
MCP-like protocol. This integration allows AI agents to invoke blockchain smart
contracts, facilitating more dynamic and context-aware interactions between
users and blockchain networks. Essentially, it empowers users to interact with
blockchain systems and perform transactions using queries in natural language.
Within this proposed architecture, blockchain smart contracts can function as
intelligent agents capable of recognizing user input in natural language and
executing the corresponding transactions. To ensure that the LLM accurately
interprets natural language inputs and maps them to the appropriate MCP
functions, the LLM was fine-tuned using a custom dataset comprising user inputs
paired with their corresponding MCP server functions. This fine-tuning process
significantly improved the platform's performance and accuracy. To validate the
effectiveness of MCC, we have developed an end-to-end prototype implemented on
the Rahasak blockchain with the fine-tuned Llama-4 LLM. To the best of our
knowledge, this research represents the first approach to using the concept of
Model Context Protocol to integrate LLMs with blockchain.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cyberattack detection in Critical Infrastructure and Supply Chains has become
challenging in Industry 4.0. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are deployed to
counter the cyberattacks. However, an IDS effectively detects attacks based on
the known signatures and patterns, Zero-day attacks go undetected. To overcome
this drawback in IDS, the integration of a Dense Neural Network (DNN) with Data
Augmentation is proposed. It makes IDS intelligent and enables it to self-learn
with high accuracy when a novel attack is encountered. The network flow
captures datasets are highly imbalanced same as the real network itself. The
Data Augmentation plays a crucial role in balancing the data. The balancing of
data is challenging as the minority class is as low as 0.000004\% of the
dataset, and the abundant class is higher than 80\% of the dataset. Synthetic
Minority Oversampling Technique is used for balancing the data. However, higher
accuracies are achieved with balanced test data, lower accuracies are
noticeable with the original imbalanced test data suggesting overfitting. A
comparison with state-of-the-art research using Synthetic Minority Oversampling
Technique with Edited Nearest Neighbor shows the classification of classes
remains poor for the original dataset. This suggests highly imbalanced datasets
of network flow require a different method of data augmentation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A policy-governed RAG architecture is specified for audit-ready generation in
regulated workflows, organized as a triptych: (I) Contracts/Control
(SHRDLU-like), which governs output adherence to legal and internal policies;
(II) Manifests/Trails (Memex-like), which cryptographically anchors all cited
source evidence to ensure verifiable provenance; and (III)
Receipts/Verification (Xanadu-like), which provides the final, portable proof
of compliance for auditors (portable COSE/JOSE) (see Section 4 and Appendix A).
Rather than explaining model internals, outputs are gated ex-ante and bound to
cryptographically verifiable evidence for each material answer. Unvalidated
targets are stated (>=20% relative reduction in confident errors; p95 latency
<= 900 ms; <= 2.2x serve cost) together with a pre-registered (optional) pilot
using NO-GO gates. The design complements existing RAG/guardrails by making
policy checks auditable, replayable, and receipt-backed. Target domains include
back-office compliance in pharma, medical devices, finance, legal, and the
public sector where error costs may exceed thousands of euros and audit trails
are mandatory under regulations such as the EU AI Act. Future evaluations may
pre-commit to publishing negative results when any example NO-GO gate is not
met.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Over the years, the technological landscape has evolved, reshaping the
security posture of organisations and increasing their exposure to
cybersecurity threats, many originating from within. Insider threats remain a
major challenge, particularly in sectors where cybersecurity infrastructure,
expertise, and regulations are still developing. This study proposes the
Insider Threat Explainable Machine Learning (IT-XML) framework, which
integrates the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) with
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to enhance proactive insider threat management and
decision-making. A quantitative approach is adopted using an online
questionnaire to assess employees' knowledge of insider threat patterns, access
control, privacy practices, and existing policies across three large
data-sensitive organisations. The IT-XML framework provides assessment
capabilities through survey-based data, HMM-driven pattern recognition for
security maturity classification, and evidence-based recommendations for
proactive threat mitigation. The framework classified all organisations at the
developing security maturity level with 97-98% confidence and achieved a
classification accuracy of 91.7%, identifying audit log access limits as the
most critical control. Random Forest analysis highlighted vendor breach
notifications (0.081) and regular audit log reviews (0.052) as key determinants
of resilience. Explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME improved model
transparency and interpretability, demonstrating the framework's potential to
strengthen insider threat management practices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mathematically constructed S-boxes arise from algebraic structures and finite
field theory to ensure strong, provable cryptographic properties. These
mathematically grounded constructions allow for generation of thousands of
S-Boxes with high nonlinearity, APN properties, and balanced avalanche
characteristics, unlike fully random methods, which lack such theoretical
guarantees in exchange for low complexity and more varied results. In this
work, we compare mathematically constructed constructions with randomly
generated ones to evaluate the relative weakness of the latter. We also
establish an average measure of performance for randomly generated
permutations, as well as random with forced cycle constraints, and compare them
to well-established designs in a simple SPN setting.

Abstract: We present a data generation framework designed to simulate spoofing attacks

network-based models for spoofing detection, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory
networks and Transformer-inspired architectures. These models are specifically
designed for online detection and are trained using the generated dataset. Our
results demonstrate that deep learning models can accurately distinguish
spoofed signals from genuine ones, achieving high detection performance. The
best results are achieved by Transformer-inspired architectures with early
fusion of the inputs resulting in an error rate of 0.16%.

Abstract: Real-world health studies require continuous and secure data collection from
mobile and wearable devices. We introduce MotionPI, a smartphone-based system
designed to collect behavioral and health data through sensors and surveys with
minimal interaction from participants. The system integrates passive data
collection (such as GPS and wristband motion data) with Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) surveys, which can be triggered randomly or based on physical
activity. MotionPI is designed to work under real-life constraints, including
limited battery life, weak or intermittent cellular connection, and minimal
user supervision. It stores data both locally and on a secure cloud server,
with encrypted transmission and storage. It integrates through Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) into wristband devices that store raw data and communicate motion
summaries and trigger events. MotionPI demonstrates a practical solution for
secure and scalable mobile data collection in cyber-physical health studies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile and
edge platforms, securing them against model extraction attacks has become a
pressing concern. However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the
performance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a
challenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance
execution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a
heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate
privacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to
untrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts
an information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy:
security-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of
attention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an
SGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are
performed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the
enclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and
evaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that
SecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance,
offering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantum computing is reshaping the security landscape of modern
telecommunications. The cryptographic foundations that secure todays 5G
systems, including RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman
(DH), are all susceptible to attacks enabled by Shors algorithm. Protecting 5G
networks against future quantum adversaries has therefore become an urgent
engineering and research priority. In this paper we introduce QORE, a
quantum-secure 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) Core framework that provides a clear
pathway for transitioning both the 5G Core Network Functions and User Equipment
(UE) to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The framework uses the
NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation
Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) and
applies them across the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). A Hybrid PQC
(HPQC) configuration is also proposed, combining classical and quantum-safe
primitives to maintain interoperability during migration. Experimental
validation shows that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance
overhead, meeting the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of
carrier-grade 5G systems. The proposed roadmap aligns with ongoing 3GPP SA3 and
SA5 study activities on the security and management of post-quantum networks as
well as with NIST PQC standardization efforts, providing practical guidance for
mitigating quantum-era risks while safeguarding long-term confidentiality and
integrity of network data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Digital transactions currently exceed trillions of dollars annually, yet
traditional paper-based agreements remain a bottleneck for automation,
enforceability, and dispute resolution. Natural language contracts introduce
ambiguity, require manual processing, and lack computational verifiability, all
of which hinder efficient digital commerce. Computable legal contracts,
expressed in machine-readable formats, offer a potential solution by enabling
automated execution and verification. Blockchain-based smart contracts further
strengthen enforceability and accelerate dispute resolution; however, current
implementations risk exposing sensitive agreement terms on public ledgers,
raising serious privacy and competitive intelligence concerns that limit
enterprise adoption.
  We introduce zk-agreements, a protocol designed to transition from
paper-based trust to cryptographic trust while preserving confidentiality. Our
design combines zero-knowledge proofs to protect private agreement terms,
secure two-party computation to enable private compliance evaluation, and smart
contracts to guarantee automated enforcement. Together, these components
achieve both privacy preservation and computational enforceability, resolving
the fundamental tension between transparency and confidentiality in
blockchain-based agreements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has driven the development of
roadway wireless charging technology, effectively extending EV driving range.
However, wireless charging introduces significant cybersecurity challenges. Any
receiver within the magnetic field can potentially extract energy, and previous
research demonstrated that a hacker could detect the operating frequency and
steal substantial power. However, our approach required time to track new
frequencies or precise adjustments of inductance and capacitance, which would
be less effective against potential rapid transmitter frequency changes or
capacitance drift. As a solution, we enhanced the interceptor and enabled it to
intrude as well as steal energy within just three cycles of the high-frequency
signal. Moreover, it can work without any circuit parameters or look-up tables.
The key innovation is synchronizing the receiver current with the phase of the
magnetic sensor voltage. Through MATLAB / Simulink simulations, finite-element
analysis, and experimental validation, we demonstrated that our improved method
can steal over 76% of the power received by a fully resonant receiver under
identical conditions. This attack demonstrates that simple frequency-changing
power encryption offers limited protection against such threats.

Abstract: Cyber threats increasingly demand joint responses, yet the organizational
dynamics behind multi-agency cybersecurity collaboration remain poorly
understood. Understanding who leads, who bridges, and how agencies coordinate
is critical for strengthening both U.S. homeland security and allied defense
efforts. In this study, we construct a co-authorship network from nine Joint
Cybersecurity Advisories (CSAs) issued between November 2024 and August 2025.
We map 41 agencies and 442 co-authoring ties to analyze the structure of
collaboration. We find a tightly knit U.S. triad -- CISA, FBI, and NSA --
densely connected with Five Eyes and select European allies. Degree centrality
identifies CISA and FBI as coordination hubs, while betweenness highlights NSA,
the UK's NCSC, and Australia's ASD-ACSC as key bridges linking otherwise
fragmented clusters. By releasing the first replicable dataset and network
analysis of CSAs, we provide new empirical evidence on how collaborative
cybersecurity signals are organized and where strategic influence is
concentrated.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advances in safety alignment, remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks designed to circumvent protective mechanisms.
Prevailing defense strategies rely on external interventions, such as input
filtering or output modification, which often lack generalizability and
compromise model utility while incurring significant computational overhead. In
this work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating
Internal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external
correction to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's
own reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent
through a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract
core semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety
awareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five open-source LLMs against six
advanced jailbreak attacks demonstrate that SAID substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in reducing harmful outputs. Crucially, it achieves
this while preserving model performance on benign tasks and incurring minimal
computational overhead. Our work establishes that activating the intrinsic
safety mechanisms of LLMs is a more robust and scalable path toward building
safer and more reliable aligned AI systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pseudorandom generators (PRGs) are a foundational primitive in classical
cryptography, underpinning a wide range of constructions. In the quantum
setting, pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) were proposed as a potentially
weaker assumption that might serve as a substitute for PRGs in cryptographic
applications. Two primary size regimes of PRSs have been studied:
logarithmic-size and linear-size. Interestingly, logarithmic PRSs have led to
powerful cryptographic applications, such as digital signatures and quantum
public-key encryption, that have not been realized from their linear
counterparts. However, PRGs have only been black-box separated from linear
PRSs, leaving open the fundamental question of whether PRGs are also separated
from logarithmic PRSs.
  In this work, we resolve this open problem. We establish a quantum black-box
separation between (quantum-evaluable) PRGs and PRSs of either size regime.
Specifically, we construct a unitary quantum oracle with inverse access
relative to which no black-box construction of PRG from (logarithmic or linear)
PRS exists. As a direct corollary, we obtain separations between PRGs and
several primitives implied by logarithmic PRSs, including digital signatures
and quantum public-key encryption.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress,
yet remain critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit weaknesses
in cross-modal processing. We present a systematic study of multimodal
jailbreaks targeting both vision-language and audio-language models, showing
that even simple perceptual transformations can reliably bypass
state-of-the-art safety filters. Our evaluation spans 1,900 adversarial prompts
across three high-risk safety categories harmful content, CBRN (Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear), and CSEM (Child Sexual Exploitation
Material) tested against seven frontier models. We explore the effectiveness of
attack techniques on MLLMs, including FigStep-Pro (visual keyword
decomposition), Intelligent Masking (semantic obfuscation), and audio
perturbations (Wave-Echo, Wave-Pitch, Wave-Speed). The results reveal severe
vulnerabilities: models with almost perfect text-only safety (0\% ASR) suffer
>75\% attack success under perceptually modified inputs, with FigStep-Pro
achieving up to 89\% ASR in Llama-4 variants. Audio-based attacks further
uncover provider-specific weaknesses, with even basic modality transfer
yielding 25\% ASR for technical queries. These findings expose a critical gap
between text-centric alignment and multimodal threats, demonstrating that
current safeguards fail to generalize across cross-modal attacks. The
accessibility of these attacks, which require minimal technical expertise,
suggests that robust multimodal AI safety will require a paradigm shift toward
broader semantic-level reasoning to mitigate possible risks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is an emerging topic to handle
secure machine learning inference over sensitive data in untrusted
environments. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation directly
on encrypted data on the server side, making it a promising approach for PPML.
However, it introduces significant communication and computation overhead on
the client side, making it impractical for edge devices. Hybrid homomorphic
encryption (HHE) addresses this limitation by combining symmetric encryption
(SE) with FHE to reduce the computational cost on the client side, and
combining with an FHE-friendly SE can also lessen the processing overhead on
the server side, making it a more balanced and efficient alternative. Our work
proposes a hardware-accelerated HHE architecture built around a lightweight
symmetric cipher optimized for FHE compatibility and implemented as a dedicated
hardware accelerator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first design to
integrate an end-to-end HHE framework with hardware acceleration. Beyond this,
we also present several microarchitectural optimizations to achieve higher
performance and energy efficiency. The proposed work is integrated into a full
PPML pipeline, enabling secure inference with significantly lower latency and
power consumption than software implementations. Our contributions validate the
feasibility of low-power, hardware- accelerated HHE for edge deployment and
provide a hardware- software co-design methodology for building scalable,
secure machine learning systems in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on a PYNQ-Z2 platform with the MNIST dataset show over a 50x
reduction in client-side encryption latency and nearly a 2x gain in hardware
throughput compared to existing FPGA-based HHE accelerators.

Abstract: There are increasing risks of privacy disclosure when sharing the automotive
location data in particular functions such as route navigation, driving
monitoring and vehicle scheduling. These risks could lead to the attacks
including user behavior recognition, sensitive location inference and
trajectory reconstruction. In order to mitigate the data security risk caused
by the automotive location sharing, this paper proposes a high-precision
privacy protection mechanism based on format-preserving encryption (FPE) of
geographical coordinates. The automotive coordinate data key mapping mechanism
is designed to reduce to the accuracy loss of the geographical location data
caused by the repeated encryption and decryption. The experimental results
demonstrate that the average relative distance retention rate (RDR) reached
0.0844, and the number of hotspots in the critical area decreased by 98.9%
after encryption. To evaluate the accuracy loss of the proposed encryption
algorithm on automotive geographical location data, this paper presents the
experimental analysis of decryption accuracy, and the result indicates that the
decrypted coordinate data achieves a restoration accuracy of 100%. This work
presents a high-precision privacy protection method for automotive location
data, thereby providing an efficient data security solution for the sensitive
data sharing in autonomous driving.

Abstract: With the wide application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in
complex fields such as autonomous driving, intelligent manufacturing, and smart
healthcare, how to improve its security and robustness in dynamic and
changeable environments has become a core issue in current research. Especially
in the face of adversarial attacks, DRL may suffer serious performance
degradation or even make potentially dangerous decisions, so it is crucial to
ensure their stability in security-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we first
introduce the basic framework of DRL and analyze the main security challenges
faced in complex and changing environments. In addition, this paper proposes an
adversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and
attack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL
in detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space,

attacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness
training strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training,
robust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related

methods in improving the robustness of DRL. Finally, this paper looks into the
future research direction of DRL in adversarial environments, emphasizing the
research needs in terms of improving generalization, reducing computational
complexity, and enhancing scalability and explainability, aiming to provide

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents
to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic
on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app
interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector:
environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual
instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by
inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed
notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can
derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible
device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce
GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under
environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving
beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events
into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators
and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a
judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the
agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,
pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive
experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to
deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive
and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for
quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more
robust and secure embodied agents.

Abstract: Pretrained deep learning model sharing holds tremendous value for researchers
and enterprises alike. It allows them to apply deep learning by fine-tuning
models at a fraction of the cost of training a brand-new model. However, model
sharing exposes end-users to cyber threats that leverage the models for
malicious purposes. Attackers can use model sharing by hiding self-executing
malware inside neural network parameters and then distributing them for
unsuspecting users to unknowingly directly execute them, or indirectly as a
dependency in another software. In this work, we propose NeuPerm, a simple yet
effec- tive way of disrupting such malware by leveraging the theoretical
property of neural network permutation symmetry. Our method has little to no
effect on model performance at all, and we empirically show it successfully
disrupts state-of-the-art attacks that were only previously addressed using
quantization, a highly complex process. NeuPerm is shown to work on LLMs, a
feat that no other previous similar works have achieved. The source code is
available at https://github.com/danigil/NeuPerm.git.

Abstract: Aggregating Message Authentication Codes (MACs) promises to save valuable
bandwidth in resource-constrained environments. The idea is simple: Instead of
appending an authentication tag to each message in a communication stream, the
integrity protection of multiple messages is aggregated into a single tag.
Recent studies postulate, e.g., based on simulations, that these benefits also
spread to wireless, and thus lossy, scenarios despite each lost packet
typically resulting in the loss of integrity protection information for
multiple messages. In this paper, we investigate these claims in a real
deployment. Therefore, we first design a MAC aggregation extension for the
Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.3 protocol. Afterward, we
extensively evaluate the performance of MAC aggregation on a complete
communication protocol stack on embedded hardware. We find that MAC aggregation
can indeed increase goodput by up to 50% and save up to 17% of energy
expenditure for the transmission of short messages, even in lossy channels.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) are key technologies
in the Industry 4.0 vision. They incorporate sensors and actuators to interact
with the physical environment. However, when creating and interconnecting
components to form a heterogeneous smart systems architecture, these face
challenges in cybersecurity. This paper presents an experimental investigation
of architectural configurations for a LoRaWAN-based Smart-Lighting project,
aimed at verifying and improving the system's robustness against attacks. We
assess the system's robustness in a series of iterative experiments conducted
both in-vitro and on-site. The results show that most attacks on a LoRaWAN
network are unsuccessful, also highlighting unresolved issues with the
installed products. The most successful attacks are high-power jamming attacks
within a few meters of the target, which, in the case of gateways, can be
mitigated through gateway redundancy.

Abstract: Existing defence mechanisms have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
mitigating rule-based Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, leveraging predefined
signatures and static heuristics to identify and block malicious traffic.
However, the emergence of AI-driven techniques presents new challenges to SDN
security, potentially compromising the efficacy of existing defence mechanisms.
In this paper, we introduce~AdaDoS, an adaptive attack model that disrupt
network operations while evading detection by existing DoS-based detectors
through adversarial reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AdaDoS models
the problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to
obstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to
identify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting
its attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.
Additionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than
defenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov
decision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay
information between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a
novel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited
observations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who
has full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents
the first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of
adaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack
detectors.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) because of
their use in wide areas of applications such as payment channels, atomic swaps,
etc, their use in exchange is still questionable. This is because of its
incentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.
  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC
(NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to
mitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners;
however, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they
consider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the
transfer collude with the miner.
  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by
presenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and
game-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC
than He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking
naive HTLC.
  Leveraging our insights, we propose \prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC
protocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \prot\ employs a two-phase
approach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as
miners. In Phase 1, parties commit to the transfer; in Phase 2, the transfer is
executed without manipulation. We demonstrate \prot's efficiency in transaction
cost and latency via implementations on Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Abstract: We examine whether measured cognitive processes predict cyber-attack
behavior. We analyzed data that included psychometric scale responses and
labeled attack behaviors from cybersecurity professionals who conducted
red-team operations against a simulated enterprise network. We employed
multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression with technique counts nested within
participants to test whether cognitive processes predicted technique-specific
usage. The scales significantly predicted technique use, but effects varied by
technique rather than operating uniformly. Neither expertise level nor
experimental treatment condition significantly predicted technique patterns,
indicating that cognitive processes may be stronger drivers of technique
selection than training or experience. These findings demonstrate that
individual cognitive differences shape cyber-attack behavior and support the
development of psychology-informed defense strategies.

Abstract: Program analysis tools often produce large volumes of candidate vulnerability
reports that require costly manual review, creating a practical challenge: how
can security analysts prioritize the reports most likely to be true
vulnerabilities?
  This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to
prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on
Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each
containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of
machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks
(GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and
LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The
top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models
reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading
model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60
ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of
0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can
detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating
strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant
architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to
poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts
as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and
sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and
stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of
modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility
algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we
demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score
to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized
MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our
algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.
