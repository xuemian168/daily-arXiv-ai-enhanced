The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop.

CircuitGuard (1) introduces a novel RTL-aware\nsimilarity metric that captures both structural and functional equivalence\nbeyond surface-level overlap, and (2) develops an activation-level steering\nmethod that identifies and attenuates transformer components most responsible\nfor memorization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CircuitGuard\nidentifies (and isolates) 275 memorization-critical features across layers\n18-28 of Llama 3.1-8B model, achieving up to 80% reduction in semantic\nsimilarity to proprietary patterns while maintaining generation quality.\nCircuitGuard further shows 78-85% cross-domain transfer effectiveness, enabling\nrobust memorization mitigation across circuit categories without retraining."}

This paper investigates whether\nincreasing the layer depth of deep neural networks affects their robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)\ndomain. We compare the adversarial robustness of various deep neural networks\nacross both \\ac{NIDS} and computer vision domains (the latter being widely used\nin adversarial attack experiments). Our experimental results reveal that in the\nNIDS domain, adding more layers does not necessarily improve their performance,\nyet it may actually significantly degrade their robustness against adversarial\nattacks. Conversely, in the computer vision domain, adding more layers exhibits\na more modest impact on robustness. These findings can guide the development of\nrobust neural networks for (NIDS) applications and highlight the unique\ncharacteristics of network security domains within the (ML) landscape."}

This paper conducts a\ncomprehensive security analysis of a commercial smart air compressor, revealing\ncritical vulnerabilities including hardcoded credentials, unauthenticated APIs,\nand an insecure update mechanism. It includes a formal threat model,\ndemonstrates practical attack scenarios in a testbed environment, and evaluates\ntheir subsequent impact on an industrial process, leading to denial of service\nand the corruption of critical process telemetry. In addition, an analysis of\nthe device's supply chain reveals how product integration from multiple vendors\nand limited security considerations can expose a device to threats. The\nfindings underscore the necessity of incorporating cybersecurity principles\ninto both IIoT device design and supply chain governance to enhance resilience\nagainst emerging industrial cyber threats."}
