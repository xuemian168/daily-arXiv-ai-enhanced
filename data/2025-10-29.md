Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive analysis of an unsupervised multi-expert
machine learning framework for detecting short ticketing fraud in railway
systems. The study introduces an A/B/C/D station classification system that
successfully identifies suspicious patterns across 30 high-risk stations. The
framework employs four complementary algorithms: Isolation Forest, Local
Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM, and Mahalanobis Distance. Key findings include
the identification of five distinct short ticketing patterns and potential for
short ticketing recovery in transportation systems.

Abstract: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a
significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of
efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine
learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad
hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their
effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a
selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection.
Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage
self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction,
eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates
neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream
classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal
fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant
improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods,
exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong
generalization.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface
enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external
data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity
and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce
critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user
data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of
MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent
hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional
web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address
these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies,
examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered
detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry
systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous
oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security
fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from
traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language
metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat
model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and
system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect
Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors,
leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more
severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user
inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability:
leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a
constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first
query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool
descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked
internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI
achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated
malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a
practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using
cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating,
storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and
cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are
generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers.
Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing
perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as
ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize
transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first
hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet,
featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation.
Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is
proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a
fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design
minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable
cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of
the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior
across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6%
of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+
FPGA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to
verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking
methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to
open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the
decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means
to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in
embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.
A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an
open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between
learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications
such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose
PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO
jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that
are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.
A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes
degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.
Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO
substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model
modifications.

Abstract: Pig butchering, and similar interactive online scams, lower their victims'
defenses by building trust over extended periods of conversation - sometimes
weeks or months. They have become increasingly public losses (at least $75B by
one recent study). However, because of their long-term conversational nature,
they are extremely challenging to investigate at scale. In this paper, we
describe the motivation, design, implementation, and experience with
CHATTERBOX, an LLM-based system that automates long-term engagement with online
scammers, making large-scale investigations of their tactics possible. We
describe the techniques we have developed to attract scam attempts, the system
and LLM-engineering required to convincingly engage with scammers, and the
necessary capabilities required to satisfy or evade "milestones" in scammers'
workflow.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning
by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and
significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates
integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU
accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads
typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally
operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate
performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing
cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g.,
Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the
potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based
verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages
the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives
that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model
execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a
common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across
different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future
capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution
environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation
that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU
infrastructures.

Abstract: Traceable signatures (Kiayas et al., EUROCRYPT 2004) is an anonymous digital
signature system that extends the tracing power of the opening authority in
group signatures. There are many known constructions of traceable signatures,
but all are based on number-theoretic/pairing assumptions. For such reason,
they may not be secure in the presence of quantum computers. This work revisits
the notion of traceable signatures and presents a lattice-based construction
provably secure in the quantum random oracle model (QROM).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mini-programs, an emerging mobile application paradigm within super-apps,
offer a seamless and installation-free experience. However, the adoption of the
web-view component has disrupted their isolation mechanisms, exposing new
attack surfaces and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel
vulnerability called Cross Mini-program Cookie Sharing (CMCS), which arises
from the shared web-view environment across mini-programs. This vulnerability
allows unauthorized data exchange across mini-programs by enabling one
mini-program to access cookies set by another within the same web-view context,
violating isolation principles. As a preliminary step, we analyzed the web-view
mechanisms of four major platforms, including WeChat, AliPay, TikTok, and
Baidu, and found that all of them are affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the collusion attack enabled by CMCS, where
privileged mini-programs exfiltrate sensitive user data via cookies accessible
to unprivileged mini-programs. To measure the impact of collusion attacks
enabled by CMCS vulnerabilities in the wild, we developed MiCoScan, a static
analysis tool that detects mini-programs affected by CMCS vulnerabilities.
MiCoScan employs web-view context modeling to identify clusters of
mini-programs sharing the same web-view domain and cross-webview data flow
analysis to detect sensitive data transmissions to/from web-views. Using
MiCoScan, we conducted a large-scale analysis of 351,483 mini-programs,
identifying 45,448 clusters sharing web-view domains, 7,965 instances of
privileged data transmission, and 9,877 mini-programs vulnerable to collusion
attacks. Our findings highlight the widespread prevalence and significant
security risks posed by CMCS vulnerabilities, underscoring the urgent need for
improved isolation mechanisms in mini-program ecosystems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cybersecurity spans multiple interconnected domains, complicating the
development of meaningful, labor-relevant benchmarks. Existing benchmarks
assess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that
pre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and
defense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address
this limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a
modular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents
across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards
meaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five
evaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs,
Attack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and
privacy assessments. Key novel contributions include systematic simultaneous
offensive-defensive evaluation, robotics-focused cybersecurity challenges
(RCTF2), and privacy-preserving performance assessment (CyberPII-Bench).
Evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals saturation on security
knowledge metrics (~70\% success) but substantial degradation in multi-step
adversarial (A\&D) scenarios (20-40\% success), or worse in robotic targets
(22\% success). The combination of framework scaffolding and LLM model choice
significantly impacts performance; we find that proper matches improve up to
2.6$\times$ variance in Attack and Defense CTFs. These results demonstrate a
pronounced gap between conceptual knowledge and adaptive capability,
emphasizing the need for a meta-benchmark.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are
vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which
utilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to
distinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing
attention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the
different environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed
user gestures.
  In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which
utilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to
determine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared
with existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance
under the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a
fingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and
elaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our
evaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing
devices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to
existing passive liveness detection schemes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As the core of the Internet infrastructure, the TCP/IP protocol stack
undertakes the task of network data transmission. However, due to the
complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction,
there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol
stack code and the RFC standard. This inconsistency may not only lead to
differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security
vulnerabilities. At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack
functions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly
important to detect and fix these inconsistencies. With the rise of large
language models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol
specifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol
stack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other
related content. However, existing methods rely on predefined patterns or
rule-based approaches that fail to generalize across different protocol
specifications. Automated and scalable detection of these inconsistencies
remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an automated
analysis framework based on LLM and differential models. By modeling the
iterative relationship of the protocol and based on the iterative update
relationship of the RFC standard, we perform incremental code function analysis
on different versions of kernel code implementations to automatically perform
code detection and vulnerability analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations to
validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in
identifying potential vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies.

Abstract: Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) deployed on memristive crossbar arrays
provide energy-efficient solutions for edge computing but are susceptible to
physical attacks due to memristor nonvolatility. Recently, Rajendran et al.
(IEEE Embedded Systems Letter 2025) proposed a Physical Unclonable Function
(PUF)-based scheme to secure BNNs against theft attacks. Specifically, the
weight and bias matrices of the BNN layers were secured by swapping columns
based on device's PUF key bits.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this scheme to secure BNNs is vulnerable
to PUF-key recovery attack. As a consequence of our attack, we recover the
secret weight and bias matrices of the BNN. Our approach is motivated by
differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing
the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model
parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could
recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification
accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very
efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the
model parameters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud
infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a
significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a
compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,
allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.
However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines
remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,
and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of
cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving
ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules
with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel
encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,
optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus
adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource
consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference
acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional
HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying
secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality
under zero-trust cloud conditions.
