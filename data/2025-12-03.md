Abstract: Deep learning models are used in safety-critical tasks such as automated driving and face recognition. However, small perturbations in the model input can significantly change the predictions. Adversarial attacks are used to identify small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications. More powerful black-box adversarial attacks are required to develop more effective defenses. A promising approach to black-box adversarial attacks is to repeat the process of extracting a specific image area and changing the perturbations added to it. Existing attacks adopt simple rectangles as the areas where perturbations are changed in a single iteration. We propose applying superpixels instead, which achieve a good balance between color variance and compactness. We also propose a new search method, versatile search, and a novel attack method, Superpixel Attack, which applies superpixels and performs versatile search. Superpixel Attack improves attack success rates by an average of 2.10% compared with existing attacks. Most models used in this study are robust against adversarial attacks, and this improvement is significant for black-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents LLMBugScanner, a large language model (LLM) based framework for smart contract vulnerability detection using fine-tuning and ensemble learning. Smart contract auditing presents several challenges for LLMs: different pretrained models exhibit varying reasoning abilities, and no single model performs consistently well across all vulnerability types or contract structures. These limitations persist even after fine-tuning individual LLMs.
  To address these challenges, LLMBugScanner combines domain knowledge adaptation with ensemble reasoning to improve robustness and generalization. Through domain knowledge adaptation, we fine-tune LLMs on complementary datasets to capture both general code semantics and instruction-guided vulnerability reasoning, using parameter-efficient tuning to reduce computational cost. Through ensemble reasoning, we leverage the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs and apply a consensus-based conflict resolution strategy to produce more reliable vulnerability assessments.
  We conduct extensive experiments across multiple popular LLMs and compare LLMBugScanner with both pretrained and fine-tuned individual models. Results show that LLMBugScanner achieves consistent accuracy improvements and stronger generalization, demonstrating that it provides a principled, cost-effective, and extensible framework for smart contract auditing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) serves as a fundamental component in random number generation and cryptographic applications, its performance and security are particularly critical in resource-constrained embedded systems, where memory capacity and computational efficiency are limited. Establishing a high-performance and secure DRBG is therefore an important issue for embedded system design. Furthermore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established the Ascon lightweight cryptographic standard in August 2025, which is suitable for use in resource-limited embedded environments. Therefore, this study revises the DRBG standard and proposes three Ascon-driven constructions: the Ascon-Driven Hash-Based DRBG, the Ascon-Driven keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) DRBG, and the Ascon-Driven Counter-mode (CTR) DRBG. In the experiments, these methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve higher computational efficiency and lower memory usage compared with existing DRBG implementations, making them suitable for deployment in embedded systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We provide a survey on the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP), which plays an important role in studying the security of public-key cryptosystems. We first review the abelian case, where Kitaev's algorithm yields an efficient quantum solution to the HSP, recalling how classical problems (such as order finding, integer factorization, and discrete logarithm) can be formulated as abelian HSP instances. We then examine the current state of the art for non-abelian HSP, where no general efficient quantum solution is known, focusing on some relevant groups including dihedral group (connected to the shortest vector problem), symmetric groups (connected to the graph isomorphism problem), and semidirect product constructions (connected, in a special case, to the code equivalence problem). We also describe the main techniques for addressing the HSP in non-abelian cases, namely Fourier sampling and the black-box approach. Throughout the paper, we highlight the mathematical notions required and exploited in this context, providing a cryptography-oriented perspective.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The field of AI Control seeks to develop robust control protocols, deployment safeguards for untrusted AI which may be intentionally subversive. However, existing protocols that rely on weaker monitors to detect unsafe behavior often fail on complex tasks beyond the monitor's comprehension. We develop control protocols based on factored cognition, in which a trusted model decomposes a task, an untrusted model solves each resultant child task in isolation, and the results are reassembled into a full solution. These protocols may improve safety by several means, such as by simplifying the context for monitors, or by obscuring vulnerabilities in the environment. We implement our protocols in the APPS coding setting and red team them against backdoor attempts from an adversarial GPT-4.1 Nano. We find that: (i) Adding factored cognition to a trusted monitoring protocol can boost safety from 41% to 63%; (ii) Safety improves because monitor performance improves; (iii) Factored cognition makes it no harder for capable LLMs to write backdoors in APPS. While our protocols show low usefulness in APPS, they hold promise for more complex tasks.

Abstract: Phishing remains one of the most prevalent online threats, exploiting human trust to harvest sensitive credentials. Existing URL- and HTML-based detection systems struggle against obfuscation and visual deception. This paper presents \textbf{PhishSnap}, a privacy-preserving, on-device phishing detection system leveraging perceptual hashing (pHash). Implemented as a browser extension, PhishSnap captures webpage screenshots, computes visual hashes, and compares them against legitimate templates to identify visually similar phishing attempts. A \textbf{2024 dataset of 10,000 URLs} (70\%/20\%/10\% train/validation/test) was collected from PhishTank and Netcraft. Due to security takedowns, a subset of phishing pages was unavailable, reducing dataset diversity. The system achieved \textbf{0.79 accuracy}, \textbf{0.76 precision}, and \textbf{0.78 recall}, showing that visual similarity remains a viable anti-phishing measure. The entire inference process occurs locally, ensuring user privacy and minimal latency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ecosystem underpins a vast portion of modern software infrastructure, powering widely used components such as Log4j, Tomcat, and Struts. However, the ubiquity of these libraries has made them prime targets for high-impact security vulnerabilities, as illustrated by incidents like Log4Shell. Despite their widespread adoption, Apache projects are not immune to recurring and severe security weaknesses. We conduct a historical analysis of the Apache ecosystem to follow the "breadcrumb trail of vulnerabilities" by compiling a comprehensive dataset of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). We examine trends in exploit recurrence, disclosure timelines, and remediation practices. Our analysis is guided by four key research questions: (1) What are the most persistent and repeated CWEs in Apache libraries? (2) How long do CVEs persist before being addressed? (3) What is the delay between CVE introduction and official disclosure? and (4) How long after disclosure are CVEs remediated? We present a detailed timeline of vulnerability lifecycle stages across Apache libraries and offer insights to improve secure coding practices, vulnerability monitoring, and remediation strategies. Our contributions include a curated dataset covering 24,285 Apache libraries, 1,285 CVEs, and 157 CWEs, along with empirical findings and developer-focused recommendations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a methodology for falsifying safety properties in robotic vehicle systems through property-guided reduction and surrogate execution. By isolating only the control logic and physical dynamics relevant to a given specification, we construct lightweight surrogate models that preserve property-relevant behaviors while eliminating unrelated system complexity. This enables scalable falsification via trace analysis and temporal logic oracles.
  We demonstrate the approach on a drone control system containing a known safety flaw. The surrogate replicates failure conditions at a fraction of the simulation cost, and a property-guided fuzzer efficiently discovers semantic violations. Our results suggest that controller reduction, when coupled with logic-aware test generation, provides a practical and scalable path toward semantic verification of cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: This work presents vQFL (vehicular Quantum Federated Learning), a new framework that leverages quantum machine learning techniques to tackle key privacy and security issues in autonomous vehicular networks. Furthermore, we propose a server-side adapted fine-tuning method, ft-VQFL,to achieve enhanced and more resilient performance. By integrating quantum federated learning with differential privacy and quantum key distribution (QKD), our quantum vanguard approach creates a multi-layered defense against both classical and quantum threats while preserving model utility. Extensive experimentation with industry-standard datasets (KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes) demonstrates that vQFL maintains accuracy comparable to standard QFL while significantly improving privacy guaranties and communication security. Our implementation using various quantum models (VQC, QCNN, and SamplerQNN) reveals minimal performance overhead despite the added security measures. This work establishes a crucial foundation for quantum-resistant autonomous vehicle systems that can operate securely in the post-quantum era while efficiently processing the massive data volumes (20-40TB/day per vehicle) generated by modern autonomous fleets. The modular design of the framework allows for seamless integration with existing vehicular networks, positioning vQFL as an essential component for future intelligent transportation infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper studies how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) undermine the security guarantees of visual CAPTCHA. We identify the attack surface where an adversary can cheaply automate CAPTCHA solving using off-the-shelf models. We evaluate 7 leading commercial and open-source MLLMs across 18 real-world CAPTCHA task types, measuring single-shot accuracy, success under limited retries, end-to-end latency, and per-solve cost. We further analyze the impact of task-specific prompt engineering and few-shot demonstrations on solver effectiveness. We reveal that MLLMs can reliably solve recognition-oriented and low-interaction CAPTCHA tasks at human-like cost and latency, whereas tasks requiring fine-grained localization, multi-step spatial reasoning, or cross-frame consistency remain significantly harder for current models. By examining the reasoning traces of such MLLMs, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of why models succeed/fail on specific CAPTCHA puzzles and use these insights to derive defense-oriented guidelines for selecting and strengthening CAPTCHA tasks. We conclude by discussing implications for platform operators deploying CAPTCHA as part of their abuse-mitigation pipeline.Code Availability (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Captcha-465E/).

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, planning, and tool usage. The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline. This study highlights the urgent need for computational provenance and resource attestation mechanisms to safeguard the emerging MCP ecosystem.

Abstract: Smart contracts are a core component of blockchain technology and are widely deployed across various scenarios. However, atomicity violations have become a potential security risk. Existing analysis tools often lack the precision required to detect these issues effectively. To address this challenge, we introduce AtomGraph, an automated framework designed for detecting atomicity violations. This framework leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to identify atomicity violations through multimodal feature learning and fusion. Specifically, driven by a collaborative learning mechanism, the model simultaneously learns from two heterogeneous modalities: extracting structural topological features from the contract's Control Flow Graph (CFG) and uncovering deep semantics from its opcode sequence. We designed an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to dynamically adjust the weights of features from each modality to achieve optimal feature fusion. Finally, GCN detects graph-level atomicity violation on the contract. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that AtomGraph achieves 96.88% accuracy and 96.97% F1 score, outperforming existing tools. Furthermore, compared to the concatenation fusion model, AtomGraph improves the F1 score by 6.4%, proving its potential in smart contract security detection.

Abstract: Cybersecurity of space infrastructures is an emerging topic, despite space-related cybersecurity incidents occurring as early as 1977 (i.e., hijacking of a satellite transmission signal). There is no single dataset that documents cyber attacks against space infrastructures that have occurred in the past; instead, these incidents are often scattered in media reports while missing many details, which we dub the missing-data problem. Nevertheless, even ``low-quality'' datasets containing such reports would be extremely valuable because of the dearth of space cybersecurity data and the sensitivity of space infrastructures which are often restricted from disclosure by governments. This prompts a research question: How can we characterize real-world cyber attacks against space infrastructures? In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a framework, including metrics, while also addressing the missing-data problem by leveraging methodologies such as the Space Attack Research and Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) and the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) to ``extrapolate'' the missing data in a principled fashion. We show how the extrapolated data can be used to reconstruct ``hypothetical but plausible'' space cyber kill chains and space cyber attack campaigns that have occurred in practice. To show the usefulness of the framework, we extract data for 108 cyber attacks against space infrastructures and show how to extrapolate this ``low-quality'' dataset containing missing information to derive 6,206 attack technique-level space cyber kill chains. Our findings include: cyber attacks against space infrastructures are getting increasingly sophisticated; successful protection of the link segment between the space and user segments could have thwarted nearly half of the 108 attacks. We will make our dataset available.

Abstract: Stablecoins such as USDT and USDC aspire to peg stability by coupling issuance controls with reserve attestations. In practice, however, the transparency is split across two worlds: verifiable on-chain traces and off-chain disclosures locked in unstructured text that are unconnected. We introduce a large language model (LLM)-based automated framework that bridges these two dimensions by aligning on-chain issuance data with off-chain disclosure statements. First, we propose an integrative framework using LLMs to capture and analyze on- and off-chain data through document parsing and semantic alignment, extracting key financial indicators from issuer attestations and mapping them to corresponding on-chain metrics. Second, we integrate multi-chain issuance records and disclosure documents within a model context protocol (MCP) framework that standardizes LLMs access to both quantitative market data and qualitative disclosure narratives. This framework enables unified retrieval and contextual alignment across heterogeneous stablecoin information sources and facilitates consistent analysis. Third, we demonstrate the capability of LLMs to operate across heterogeneous data modalities in blockchain analytics, quantifying discrepancies between reported and observed circulation and examining their implications for cross-chain transparency and price dynamics. Our findings reveal systematic gaps between disclosed and verifiable data, showing that LLM-assisted analysis enhances cross-modal transparency and supports automated, data-driven auditing in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: USDT, a stablecoin pegged to dollar, has become a preferred choice for money laundering due to its stability, anonymity, and ease of use. Notably, a new form of money laundering on stablecoins -- we refer to as crowdsourcing laundering -- disperses funds through recruiting a large number of ordinary individuals, and has rapidly emerged as a significant threat. However, due to the refined division of labor, crowdsourcing laundering transactions exhibit diverse patterns and a polycentric structure, posing significant challenges for detection. In this paper, we introduce transaction group as auxiliary information, and propose the Multi-Task Collaborative Crowdsourcing Laundering Detection (MCCLD) framework. MCCLD employs an end-to-end graph neural network to realize collaboration between laundering transaction detection and transaction group detection tasks, enhancing detection performance on diverse patterns within crowdsourcing laundering group. These two tasks are jointly optimized through a shared classifier, with a shared feature encoder that fuses multi-level feature embeddings to provide rich transaction semantics and potential group information. Extensive experiments on both crowdsourcing and general laundering demonstrate MCCLD's effectiveness and generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on crowdsourcing laundering detection.

Abstract: Public-key cryptography algorithms have evolved towards increasing computational complexity to hide desired messages, which is accelerating with the development of the Internet and quantum computing. This paper introduces a novel public-key cryptography algorithm that generates ciphertexts by counting the number of elements in randomly extracted subsets from a multiset. After explaining the novel cryptographic concept, the process of mathematically refining it using satisfiability problems is described. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are: first, it is significantly faster than other public-key algorithms; second, it does not require big numbers, making it executable on any devices; and third, it can be easily extended into a public-key cryptosystem using a single public key and multiple private keys while maintaining quantum resistance.

Abstract: Recent years have shown increased cyber attacks targeting less secure elements in the software supply chain and causing significant damage to businesses and organizations. The US and EU governments and industry are equally interested in enhancing software security, including supply chain and vulnerability response. On June 26, 2025, researchers from the NSF-supported Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) and the Software Innovation Campus Paderborn (SICP) conducted a Vulnerability Response Summit with a diverse set of 9 practitioners from 9 companies. The goal of the Summit is to enable sharing between industry practitioners having practical experiences and challenges with software supply chain security, including vulnerability response, and helping to form new collaborations. We conducted five panel discussions based on open-ended questions regarding experiences with vulnerability reports, tools used for vulnerability discovery and management, organizational structures to report vulnerability response and management, preparedness and implementations for Cyber Resilience Act1 (CRA) and NIS22, and bug bounties. The open discussions enabled mutual sharing and shed light on common challenges that industry practitioners with practical experience face when securing their software supply chain, including vulnerability response. In this paper, we provide a summary of the Summit. Full panel questions can be found in the appendix.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many general-purpose natural language processing tasks. However, their ability to perform deep reasoning and mathematical analysis, particularly for complex tasks as required in cryptography, remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of suitable data for evaluation and training. To address this gap, we present CryptoQA, the first large-scale question-answering (QA) dataset specifically designed for cryptography. CryptoQA contains over two million QA pairs drawn from curated academic sources, along with contextual metadata that can be used to test the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs and to train new LLMs on cryptographic tasks. We benchmark 15 state-of-the-art LLMs on CryptoQA, evaluating their factual accuracy, mathematical reasoning, consistency, referencing, backward reasoning, and robustness to adversarial samples. In addition to quantitative metrics, we provide expert reviews that qualitatively assess model outputs and establish a gold-standard baseline. Our results reveal significant performance deficits of LLMs, particularly on tasks that require formal reasoning and precise mathematical knowledge. This shows the urgent need for LLM assistants tailored to cryptography research and development. We demonstrate that, by using CryptoQA, LLMs can be fine-tuned to exhibit better performance on cryptographic tasks.

Abstract: Are Capture-the-Flag competitions obsolete? In 2025, Cybersecurity AI (CAI) systematically conquered some of the world's most prestigious hacking competitions, achieving Rank #1 at multiple events and consistently outperforming thousands of human teams. Across five major circuits-HTB's AI vs Humans, Cyber Apocalypse (8,129 teams), Dragos OT CTF, UWSP Pointer Overflow, and the Neurogrid CTF showdown-CAI demonstrated that Jeopardy-style CTFs have become a solved game for well-engineered AI agents. At Neurogrid, CAI captured 41/45 flags to claim the $50,000 top prize; at Dragos OT, it sprinted 37% faster to 10K points than elite human teams; even when deliberately paused mid-competition, it maintained top-tier rankings. Critically, CAI achieved this dominance through our specialized alias1 model architecture, which delivers enterprise-scale AI security operations at unprecedented cost efficiency and with augmented autonomy-reducing 1B token inference costs from $5,940 to just $119, making continuous security agent operation financially viable for the first time. These results force an uncomfortable reckoning: if autonomous agents now dominate competitions designed to identify top security talent at negligible cost, what are CTFs actually measuring? This paper presents comprehensive evidence of AI capability across the 2025 CTF circuit and argues that the security community must urgently transition from Jeopardy-style contests to Attack & Defense formats that genuinely test adaptive reasoning and resilience-capabilities that remain uniquely human, for now.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to post-quantum cryptography that employs directed-graph decryption of noise-enhanced high-memory convolutional codes. The proposed construction generates random-like generator matrices that effectively conceal algebraic structure and resist known structural attacks. Security is further reinforced by the deliberate injection of strong noise during decryption, arising from polynomial division: while legitimate recipients retain polynomial-time decoding, adversaries face exponential-time complexity. As a result, the scheme achieves cryptanalytic security margins surpassing those of Classic McEliece by factors exceeding 2^(200). Beyond its enhanced security, the method offers greater design flexibility, supporting arbitrary plaintext lengths with linear-time decryption and uniform per-bit computational cost, enabling seamless scalability to long messages. Practical deployment is facilitated by parallel arrays of directed-graph decoders, which identify the correct plaintext through polynomial ambiguity while allowing efficient hardware and software implementations. Altogether, the scheme represents a compelling candidate for robust, scalable, and quantum-resistant public-key cryptography.

Abstract: Move is a research-oriented programming language design for secure and verifiable smart contract development and has been widely used in managing billions of digital assets in blockchains, such as Sui and Aptos. Move features a strong static type system and explicit resource semantics to enforce safety properties such as the prevention of data races, invalid asset transfers, and entry vulnerabilities. However, smart contracts written in Move may still contain certain vulnerabilities that are beyond the reach of its type system. It is thus essential to validate Move smart contracts. Unfortunately, due to its strong type system, existing smart contract fuzzers are ineffective in producing syntactically or semantically valid transactions to test Move smart contracts. This paper introduces the first fuzzing framework, Belobog, for Move smart contracts. Belobog is type-aware and ensures that all generated and mutated transactions are well-typed. More specifically, for a target Move smart contract, Belobog first constructs a type graph based on Move's type system, and then generates or mutates a transaction based on the graph trace derived from the type graph. In order to overcome the complex checks in Move smart contracts, we further design and implement a concolic executor in Belobog. We evaluated Belobog on 109 real-world Move smart contract projects. The experimental results show that Belobog is able to detect 100\% critical and 79\% major vulnerabilities manually audited by human experts. We further selected two recent notorious incidents in Move smart contracts, i.e., Cetus and Nemo. Belobog successfully reproduced full exploits for both of them, without any prior knowledge.
