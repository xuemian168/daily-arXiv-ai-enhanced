Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables arithmetic operations to be performed directly on encrypted data. It is essential for privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning, medical diagnosis, and financial data analysis. In popular HE schemes, ciphertext multiplication is only defined for two inputs. However, the multiplication of multiple inputs is needed in many HE applications. In our previous work, a three-input ciphertext multiplication method for the CKKS HE scheme was developed. This paper first reformulates the three-input ciphertext multiplication to enable the combination of computations in order to further reduce the complexity. The second contribution is extending the multiplication to multiple inputs without compromising the noise overhead. Additional evaluation keys are introduced to achieve relinearization of polynomial multiplication results. To minimize the complexity of the large number of rescaling units in the multiplier, a theoretical analysis is developed to relocate the rescaling, and a multi-level rescaling approach is proposed to implement combined rescaling with complexity similar to that of a single rescaling unit. Guidelines and examples are provided on the input partition to enable the combination of more rescaling. Additionally, efficient hardware architectures are designed to implement our proposed multipliers. The improved three-input ciphertext multiplier reduces the logic area and latency by 15% and 50%, respectively, compared to the best prior design. For multipliers with more inputs, ranging from 4 to 12, the architectural analysis reveals 32% savings in area and 45% shorter latency, on average, compared to prior work.

Abstract: The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is happening at a rapid pace. To ensure fast and safe charging, complex communication is required between the vehicle and the charging station. In the globally used Combined Charging System (CCS), this communication is carried over the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) physical layer. However, HPGP is known to suffer from wireless leakage, which may expose this data link to nearby attackers.
  In this paper, we examine active wireless attacks against CCS, and study the impact they can have. We present the first real-time Software-Defined Radio (SDR) implementation of HPGP, granting unprecedented access to the communications within the charging cables. We analyze the characteristics of 2,750 real-world charging sessions to understand the timing constraints for hijacking. Using novel techniques to increase the attacks' reliability, we design a robust wireless Man-in-the-Middle evaluation framework for CCS.
  We demonstrate full control over TLS usage and CCS protocol version negotiation, including TLS stripping attacks. We investigate how real devices respond to safety-critical MitM attacks, which modify power delivery information, and found target vehicles to be highly permissive. First, we caused a vehicle to display charging power exceeding 900 kW on the dashboard, while receiving only 40 kW. Second, we remotely overcharged a vehicle, at twice the requested current for 17 seconds before the vehicle triggered the emergency shutdown. Finally, we propose a backwards-compatible, downgrade-proof protocol extension to mitigate the underlying vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities but risk memorizing sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from their training data, posing significant privacy concerns. While machine unlearning techniques aim to remove such data, they predominantly depend on access to the training data. This requirement is often impractical, as training data in real-world deployments is commonly proprietary or inaccessible. To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace. Extensive experiments on the AI4Privacy PII-Masking dataset using Pythia models demonstrate that our method effectively removes target PII while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: Virtualization is widely adopted in cloud systems to manage resource sharing among users. A virtualized environment usually deploys a virtual switch within the host system to enable virtual machines to communicate with each other and with the physical network. The Open vSwitch (OVS) is one of the most popular software-based virtual switches. It maintains a cache hierarchy to accelerate packet forwarding from the host to virtual machines. We characterize the caching system inside OVS from a security perspective and identify three attack primitives. Based on the attack primitives, we present three remote attacks via OVS, breaking the isolation in virtualized environments. First, we identify remote covert channels using different caches. Second, we present a novel header recovery attack that leaks a remote user's packet header fields, breaking the confidentiality guarantees from the system. Third, we demonstrate a remote packet rate monitoring attack that recovers the packet rate of a remote victim. To defend against these attacks, we also discuss and evaluate mitigation solutions.

Abstract: Realistic network traffic simulation is critical for evaluating intrusion detection systems, stress-testing network protocols, and constructing high-fidelity environments for cybersecurity training. While attack traffic can often be layered into training environments using red-teaming or replay methods, generating authentic benign background traffic remains a core challenge -- particularly in simulating the complex temporal and communication dynamics of real-world networks. This paper introduces TempoNet, a novel generative model that combines multi-task learning with multi-mark temporal point processes to jointly model inter-arrival times and all packet- and flow-header fields. TempoNet captures fine-grained timing patterns and higher-order correlations such as host-pair behavior and seasonal trends, addressing key limitations of GAN-, LLM-, and Bayesian-based methods that fail to reproduce structured temporal variation. TempoNet produces temporally consistent, high-fidelity traces, validated on real-world datasets. Furthermore, we show that intrusion detection models trained on TempoNet-generated background traffic perform comparably to those trained on real data, validating its utility for real-world security applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems integrate document retrieval with large language models and have been widely adopted. However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies. Our work reveals significant security gaps and highlights the pressing need for stronger safeguards for RAG.

Abstract: As digital threats continue to grow, organizations must find ways to enhance security while protecting user privacy. This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in achieving this balance. AI technologies can improve security by detecting threats, monitoring systems, and automating responses. However, using AI also raises privacy concerns that need careful consideration.We examine real-world examples from the healthcare sector to illustrate how organizations can implement AI solutions that strengthen security without compromising patient privacy. Additionally, we discuss the importance of creating transparent AI systems and adhering to privacy regulations.Ultimately, this paper provides insights and recommendations for integrating AI into healthcare security practices, helping organizations navigate the challenges of modern management while keeping patient data safe.

Abstract: High-dimensional malware datasets often exhibit feature redundancy, instability, and scalability limitations, which hinder the effectiveness and interpretability of machine learning-based malware detection systems. Although feature selection is commonly employed to mitigate these issues, many existing approaches lack robustness when applied to large-scale and heterogeneous malware data. To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation. Additional analyses demonstrate low inter-feature redundancy and improved interpretability through SHAP-based explanations. Runtime and memory profiling further indicate reduced downstream classification overhead. Overall, CAFE-GB provides a stable, interpretable, and scalable feature selection strategy for large-scale malware detection.

Abstract: Monolithic Firmware is widespread. Unsurprisingly, fuzz testing firmware is an active research field with new advances addressing the unique challenges in the domain. However, understanding and evaluating improvements by deriving metrics such as code coverage and unique crashes are problematic, leading to a desire for a reliable bug-based benchmark. To address the need, we design and build FirmReBugger, a holistic framework for fairly assessing monolithic firmware fuzzers with a realistic, diverse, bug-based benchmark. FirmReBugger proposes using bug oracles--C syntax expressions of bug descriptors--with an interpreter to automate analysis and accurately report on bugs discovered, discriminating between states of detected, triggered, reached and not reached. Importantly, our idea of benchmarking does not modify the target binary and simply replays fuzzing seeds to isolate the benchmark implementation from the fuzzer while providing a simple means to extend with new bug oracles. Further, analyzing fuzzing roadblocks, we created FirmBench, a set of diverse, real-world binary targets with 313 software bug oracles. Incorporating our analysis of roadblocks challenging monolithic firmware fuzzing, the bench provides for rapid evaluation of future advances. We implement FirmReBugger in a FuzzBench-for-Firmware type service and use FirmBench to evaluate 9 state-of-the art monolithic firmware fuzzers in the style of a reproducibility study, using a 10 CPU-year effort, to report our findings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Generative Application Firewall (GAF), a new architectural layer for securing LLM applications. Existing defenses -- prompt filters, guardrails, and data-masking -- remain fragmented; GAF unifies them into a single enforcement point, much like a WAF coordinates defenses for web traffic, while also covering autonomous agents and their tool interactions.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of internet of things (IoT) devices have created a pervasive ecosystem where encrypted wireless communications serve as the primary privacy and security protection mechanism. While encryption effectively protects message content, packet metadata and statistics inadvertently expose device identities and user contexts. Various studies have exploited raw packet statistics and their visual representations for device fingerprinting and identification. However, these approaches remain confined to the spatial domain with limited feature representation. Therefore, this paper presents CONTEX-T, a novel framework that exploits contextual privacy vulnerabilities using spectral representation of encrypted wireless traffic for IoT device characterization. The experiments show that spectral analysis provides new and rich feature representation for covert reconnaissance attacks, revealing a complex and expanding threat landscape that would require robust countermeasures for IoT security management. CONTEXT-T first transforms raw packet length sequences into time-frequency spectral representations and then utilizes transformer-based spectral analysis for the device identification. We systematically evaluated multiple spectral representation techniques and transformer-based models across encrypted traffic samples from various IoT devices. CONTEXT-T effectively exploited privacy vulnerabilities and achieved device classification accuracy exceeding 99% across all devices while remaining completely passive and undetectable.

Abstract: Machine learning property attestations allow provers (e.g., model providers or owners) to attest properties of their models/datasets to verifiers (e.g., regulators, customers), enabling accountability towards regulations and policies. But, current approaches do not support generative models or large datasets. We present PAL*M, a property attestation framework for large generative models, illustrated using large language models. PAL*M defines properties across training and inference, leverages confidential virtual machines with security-aware GPUs for coverage of CPU-GPU operations, and proposes using incremental multiset hashing over memory-mapped datasets to efficiently track their integrity. We implement PAL*M on Intel TDX and NVIDIA H100, showing it is efficient, scalable, versatile, and secure.
