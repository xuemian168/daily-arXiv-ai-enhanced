Abstract: Democracies are built upon secure and reliable voting systems. Electronic voting systems seek to replace ballot papers and boxes with computer hardware and software. Proposed electronic election schemes have been subjected to scrutiny, with researchers spotting inherent faults and weaknesses. Inspired by physical voting systems, we argue that any electronic voting system needs two essential properties: ballot secrecy and verifiability. These properties seemingly work against each other. An election scheme that is a complete black box offers ballot secrecy, but verification of the outcome is impossible. This challenge can be tackled using standard tools from modern cryptography, reaching a balance that delivers both properties.
  This tutorial makes these ideas accessible to readers outside electronic voting. We introduce fundamental concepts such as asymmetric and homomorphic encryption, which we use to describe a general electronic election scheme while keeping mathematical formalism minimal. We outline game-based cryptography, a standard approach in modern cryptography, and introduce notation for formulating elections as games. We then give precise definitions of ballot secrecy and verifiability in the framework of game-based cryptography. A principal aim is introducing modern research approaches to electronic voting.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks remain a persistent threat to large language model safety. We propose Context-Conditioned Delta Steering (CC-Delta), an SAE-based defense that identifies jailbreak-relevant sparse features by comparing token-level representations of the same harmful request with and without jailbreak context. Using paired harmful/jailbreak prompts, CC-Delta selects features via statistical testing and applies inference-time mean-shift steering in SAE latent space. Across four aligned instruction-tuned models and twelve jailbreak attacks, CC-Delta achieves comparable or better safety-utility tradeoffs than baseline defenses operating in dense latent space. In particular, our method clearly outperforms dense mean-shift steering on all four models, and particularly against out-of-distribution attacks, showing that steering in sparse SAE feature space offers advantages over steering in dense activation space for jailbreak mitigation. Our results suggest off-the-shelf SAEs trained for interpretability can be repurposed as practical jailbreak defenses without task-specific training.

Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a promising technology for confidential cloud computing, as it allows computations on encrypted data. However, HE is computationally expensive and often memory-bound on conventional computer architectures. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is an alternative hardware architecture that integrates processing units and memory on the same chip or memory module. PIM enables higher memory bandwidth than conventional architectures and could thus be suitable for accelerating HE. In this work, we present DRAMatic, which implements operations foundational to HE on UPMEM's programmable, general-purpose PIM system, and evaluate its performance. DRAMatic incorporates many arithmetic optimizations, including residue number system and number-theoretic transform techniques, and can support the large parameters required for secure homomorphic evaluations. To compare performance, we evaluate DRAMatic against Microsoft SEAL, a popular open-source HE library, regarding both runtime and energy efficiency. The results show that DRAMatic significantly closes the gap between UPMEM PIM and Microsoft SEAL. However, we also show that DRAMatic is currently constrained by UPMEM PIM's multiplication performance and data transfer overhead. Finally, we discuss potential hardware extensions to UPMEM PIM.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The widespread adoption of NoSQL databases has made digital forensics increasingly difficult as storage formats are diverse and often opaque, and audit logs cannot be assumed trustworthy when privileged insiders, such as DevOps or administrators, can disable, suppress, or manipulate logging to conceal activity. We present RADAR (Record & Artifact Detection, Alignment & Reporting), a log-adversary-aware framework that derives forensic ground truth by cross-referencing low-level storage artifacts against high-level application logs. RADAR analyzes artifacts reconstructed by the Automated NoSQL Carver (ANOC), which infers layouts and carves records directly from raw disk bytes, bypassing database APIs and the management system entirely, thereby treating physical storage as the independent evidence source. RADAR then reconciles carved artifacts with the audit log to identify delta artifacts such as unlogged insertions, silent deletions, and field-level updates that exist on disk but are absent from the logical history. We evaluate RADAR across ten NoSQL engines, including BerkeleyDB, LMDB, MDBX, etcd, ZODB, Durus, LiteDB, Realm, RavenDB, and NitriteDB, spanning key-value and document stores and multiple storage designs, e.g., copy-on-write/MVCC, B/B+ tree, and append-only. Under log-evasion scenarios, such as log suppression and post-maintenance attacks, including cases where historical bytes are pruned, RADAR consistently exposes unattributed operations while sustaining 31.7-397 MB/min processing throughput, demonstrating the feasibility of log-independent, trustworthy NoSQL forensics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) run on external clouds: users send a prompt, pay for inference, and must trust that the remote GPU executes the LLM without any adversarial tampering. We critically ask how to achieve verifiable LLM inference, where a prover (the service) must convince a verifier (the client) that an inference was run correctly without rerunning the LLM. Existing cryptographic works are too slow at the LLM scale, while non-cryptographic ones require a strong verifier GPU. We propose TensorCommitments (TCs), a tensor-native proof-of-inference scheme. TC binds the LLM inference to a commitment, an irreversible tag that breaks under tampering, organized in our multivariate Terkle Trees. For LLaMA2, TC adds only 0.97% prover and 0.12% verifier time over inference while improving robustness to tailored LLM attacks by up to 48% over the best prior work requiring a verifier GPU.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Binary code analysis plays an essential role in cybersecurity, facilitating reverse engineering to reveal the inner workings of programs in the absence of source code. Traditional approaches, such as static and dynamic analysis, extract valuable insights from stripped binaries, but often demand substantial expertise and manual effort. Recent advances in deep learning have opened promising opportunities to enhance binary analysis by capturing latent features and disclosing underlying code semantics. Despite the growing number of binary analysis models based on machine learning, their robustness to adversarial code transformations at the binary level remains underexplored. We evaluate the robustness of deep learning models for the task of binary code similarity detection (BCSD) under semantics-preserving transformations. The unique nature of machine instructions presents distinct challenges compared to the typical input perturbations found in other domains. We introduce asmFooler, a system that evaluates the resilience of BCSD models using a diverse set of adversarial code transformations that preserve functional semantics. We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Operating System (OS) fingerprinting is critical for network security, but conventional methods do not provide formal uncertainty quantification mechanisms. Conformal Prediction (CP) could be directly wrapped around existing methods to obtain prediction sets with guaranteed coverage. However, a direct application of CP would treat OS identification as a flat classification problem, ignoring the natural taxonomic structure of OSs and providing brittle point predictions. This work addresses these limitations by introducing and evaluating two distinct structured CP strategies: level-wise CP (L-CP), which calibrates each hierarchy level independently, and projection-based CP (P-CP), which ensures structural consistency by projecting leaf-level sets upwards. Our results demonstrate that, while both methods satisfy validity guarantees, they expose a fundamental trade-off between level-wise efficiency and structural consistency. L-CP yields tighter prediction sets suitable for human forensic analysis but suffers from taxonomic inconsistencies. Conversely, P-CP guarantees hierarchically consistent, nested sets ideal for automated policy enforcement, albeit at the cost of reduced efficiency at coarser levels.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), particularly in sensitive environments, has raised considerable privacy concerns. Of particular importance are membership inference attacks (MIAs), which exploit behavioral discrepancies between training and non-training data to determine whether a specific record was included in the model's training set, thereby presenting significant privacy risks. Although existing defenses, such as adversarial regularization, DP-SGD, and MemGuard, assist in mitigating these threats, they often entail trade-offs such as compromising utility, increased computational requirements, or inconsistent protection against diverse attack vectors.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel inference-time defense mechanism called Neighborhood Blending, which mitigates MIAs without retraining the model or incurring significant computational overhead. Our approach operates post-training by smoothing the model's confidence outputs based on the neighborhood of a queried sample. By averaging predictions from similar training samples selected using differentially private sampling, our method establishes a consistent confidence pattern, rendering members and non-members indistinguishable to an adversary while maintaining high utility. Significantly, Neighborhood Blending maintains label integrity (zero label loss) and ensures high utility through an adaptive, "pay-as-you-go" distortion strategy. It is a model-agnostic approach that offers a practical, lightweight solution that enhances privacy without sacrificing model utility. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models, we demonstrate that our defense significantly reduces MIA success rates while preserving model performance, outperforming existing post-hoc defenses like MemGuard and training-time techniques like DP-SGD in terms of utility retention.

Abstract: We present CryptoChoreo, a choreography language for the specification of cryptographic protocols. Choreographies can be regarded as an extension of Alice-and-Bob notation, providing an intuitive high-level view of the protocol as a whole (rather than specifying each protocol role in isolation). The extensions over standard Alice-and-Bob notation that we consider are non-deterministic choice, conditional branching, and mutable long-term memory. We define the semantics of CryptoChoreo by translation to a process calculus. This semantics entails an understanding of the protocol: it determines how agents parse and check incoming messages and how they construct outgoing messages, in the presence of an arbitrary algebraic theory and non-deterministic choices made by other agents. While this semantics entails algebraic problems that are in general undecidable, we give an implementation for a representative theory. We connect this translation to ProVerif and show on a number of case studies that the approach is practically feasible.

Abstract: Hardware-secured remote attestation is essential to establishing trust in the integrity of confidential virtual machines (cVMs), but is difficult to use in practice because verifying attestation evidence requires the use of hardware-specific cryptographic logic. This increases both maintenance costs and the verifiers' trusted computing base. We introduce the concept of self-verifying remote attestation evidence. Each attestation bundle includes verification logic as a WebAssembly component signed by a trusted party. This approach transforms evidence verification into a standard code-signing problem: the verifier checks the signature on the embedded logic and then executes it to validate the evidence. As a result, verifiers can validate attestation evidence without any platform-specific knowledge. We implement this concept as TrustMee, a platform-agnostic verification driver for the Trustee framework. We demonstrate its functionality with self-verifying evidence for AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX attestations, producing attestation claims in the standard EAT Attestation Result (EAR) format.

Abstract: Rapidly evolving cyberattacks demand incident response systems that can autonomously learn and adapt to changing threats. Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs.
