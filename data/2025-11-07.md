Abstract: Most intrusion detection systems still identify attacks only after
significant damage has occurred, detecting late-stage tactics rather than early
indicators of compromise. This paper introduces a temporal analysis framework
and taxonomy for time-aware network intrusion detection. Through a systematic
review of over 40 studies published between 2020 and 2025, we classify NIDS
methods according to their treatment of time, from static per-flow analysis to
multi-window sequential modeling. The proposed taxonomy reveals that inter-flow
sequential and temporal window-based methods provide the broadest temporal
coverage across MITRE ATT&CK tactics, enabling detection from Reconnaissance
through Impact stages. Our analysis further exposes systematic bias in widely
used datasets, which emphasize late-stage attacks and thus limit progress
toward early detection. This framework provides essential groundwork for
developing IDS capable of anticipating rather than merely reacting to cyber
threats, advancing the field toward truly proactive defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Child sexual abuse is among the most hideous crimes, yet, after the COVID-19
pandemic, there is a huge surge in the distribution of child sexual abuse
material (CSAM). Traditionally, the exchange of such material is performed on
the dark web, as it provides many privacy guarantees that facilitate illicit
trades. However, the introduction of end-to-end encryption platforms has
brought it to the deep web. In this work, we report our findings for a campaign
of spreading child sexual abuse material on the clear web. The campaign
utilized at least 1,026 web pages for at least 738,286 registered users. Our
analysis details the operation of such a campaign, showcasing how social
networks are abused and the role of bots, but also the bypasses that are used.
Going a step further and exploiting operational faults in the campaign, we gain
insight into the demand for such content, as well as the dynamics of the user
network that supports it.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are
increasingly foundational to complex, distributed workflows. Yet, the security
of their underlying communication protocols remains critically under-examined.
This paper presents the first empirical, comparative security analysis of the
official CORAL implementation and a high-fidelity, SDK-based ACP
implementation, benchmarked against a literature-based evaluation of A2A. Using
a 14 point vulnerability taxonomy, we systematically assess their defenses
across authentication, authorization, integrity, confidentiality, and
availability. Our results reveal a pronounced security dichotomy: CORAL
exhibits a robust architectural design, particularly in its transport-layer
message validation and session isolation, but suffers from critical
implementation-level vulnerabilities, including authentication and
authorization failures at its SSE gateway. Conversely, ACP's architectural
flexibility, most notably its optional JWS enforcement, translates into
high-impact integrity and confidentiality flaws. We contextualize these
findings within current industry trends, highlighting that existing protocols
remain insufficiently secure. As a path forward, we recommend a hybrid approach
that combines CORAL's integrated architecture with ACP's mandatory per-message
integrity guarantees, laying the groundwork for resilient, next-generation
agent communications.

Abstract: Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures, such as water treatment
facilities, represent significant threats to public health, safety, and the
environment. This paper introduces a systematic approach for modeling and
assessing covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that leverage system
identification techniques to inform the attack design. We focus on the
attacker's ability to deploy a covert controller, and we evaluate
countermeasures based on the Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD)
anomaly detection method. Using a second-order linear time-invariant with time
delay model, representative of water treatment dynamics, we design and simulate
stealthy attacks. Our results highlight how factors such as system noise and
inaccuracies in the attacker's plant model influence the attack's stealthiness,
underscoring the need for more robust detection strategies in industrial
control environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Software fuzzing has become a cornerstone in automated vulnerability
discovery, yet existing mutation strategies often lack semantic awareness,
leading to redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states. In
this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and
dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and
semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow
information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to
generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution,
I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback
signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output
semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program
behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++,
combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity
metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets,
including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves
faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number
of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. This work highlights the
potential of combining LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback to accelerate
and deepen vulnerability discovery.

Abstract: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, it has become critical to develop more efficient and
interpretable detection methods. Traditional detection systems often struggle
with scalability and transparency, hindering real-time response and
understanding of attack vectors. This paper presents an automated framework for
detecting and interpreting DDoS attacks using machine learning (ML). The
proposed method leverages the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) to
automate the selection and optimization of ML models and features, reducing the
need for manual experimentation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is
incorporated to enhance model interpretability, providing detailed insights
into the contribution of individual features to the detection process. By
combining TPOT's automated pipeline selection with SHAP interpretability, this
approach improves the accuracy and transparency of DDoS detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that key features such as mean backward packet length and
minimum forward packet header length are critical in detecting DDoS attacks,
offering a scalable and explainable cybersecurity solution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce
ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While
effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new
class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this
work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering
attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement
learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data
augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By
iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and
applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges
toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on
three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3,
and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while
requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical
feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks
for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities
in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust
defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The widespread deployment of high-resolution visual sensing systems, coupled
with the rise of foundation models, has amplified privacy risks in video-based
applications. Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically
guaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but
challenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability,
and enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a
novel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the
theoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method
adaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity,
leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared
to the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by
retaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space
overhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and
parallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and
PPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and
significant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack
experiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing
identity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time
privacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring,
driver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The use of blockchains for data certification and traceability is now well
established in both the literature and practical applications. However, while
blockchain-based certification of individual data is clear and straightforward,
the use of blockchain to certify large amounts of data produced on a nearly
continuous basis still poses some challenges. In such a case, in fact, it is
first necessary to collect the data in an off-chain buffer, and then to
organize it, e.g., via Merkle trees, in order to keep the size and quantity of
certification data to be written to the blockchain small. In this paper, we
consider a typical system for blockchain-based traceability of a production
process, and propose and comparatively analyze some strategies for certifying
the data of such a process on blockchain, while maintaining the possibility of
verifying their certification in a decentralized way.

Abstract: Magecart skimming attacks have emerged as a significant threat to client-side
security and user trust in online payment systems. This paper addresses the
challenge of achieving robust and explainable detection of Magecart attacks
through a comparative study of various Machine Learning (ML) models with a
real-world dataset. Tree-based, linear, and kernel-based models were applied,
further enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, to
distinguish between benign and malicious scripts. Such models are supported by
a Behavior Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) which captures structural
behavior patterns in scripts, helping to analyze and classify client-side
script execution logs. To ensure robustness against adversarial evasion
attacks, the ML models were adversarially trained and evaluated using attacks
from the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox and the Adaptative Perturbation Pattern
Method. In addition, concise explanations of ML model decisions are provided,
supporting transparency and user trust. Experimental validation demonstrated
high detection performance and interpretable reasoning, demonstrating that
traditional ML models can be effective in real-world web security contexts.

Abstract: The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage
capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the
process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of
safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption
at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to
various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing
has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of
hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's
Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts
within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even
with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we
have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and
ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a
thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies,
performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose.
In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible
weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on
the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security
infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation
for Confidential Computing.
