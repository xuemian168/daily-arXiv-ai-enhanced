In resource-constrained settings, commonly deployed rule-based intrusion detection systems lack the adaptability and ethical safeguards needed to address evolving attack patterns, leading to undetected breaches and excessive blocking of legitimate traffic. This study proposes an Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) framework that integrates reinforcement learning, an explicit ethical governance layer, and human oversight to deliver adaptive and trustworthy cybersecurity. A CPU-optimized simulation environment was developed using a five-node network topology that mirrors key elements of Uganda's critical digital infrastructure and generates both benign and malicious traffic, including phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. A Q-learning agent, operating within clearly defined ethical constraints and subject to human auditability, was trained and evaluated against a traditional rule-based baseline. The AAI framework achieved a 100 percent detection rate, zero false positives, and full ethical compliance, compared with 70 percent detection and 15 percent false positives for the baseline system. These results demonstrate that agentic, ethically governed reinforcement learning can substantially improve cybersecurity effectiveness and fairness in CPU-only, resource-constrained environments, offering a practical pathway for operationalizing responsible AI in Uganda's national cybersecurity strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional access controls are insufficient, as privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may use information in ways that compromise privacy, such as messaging humans, sharing context with other agents, making tool calls, persisting data, or generating derived private information. Existing approaches often treat privacy as a binary constraint, whether data is shareable or not, overlooking nuanced, role-specific, and computation-dependent privacy needs essential for regulatory compliance.\n  Agents, including those based on large language models, are inherently probabilistic and heuristic. There is no formal guarantee of how an agent will behave for any query, making them ill-suited for operations critical to security. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a four-tiered framework for fine-grained, encrypted agent communication that adds a protection layer atop any AI agent platform. AgentCrypt spans unrestricted data exchange (Level 1) to fully encrypted computation using techniques such as homomorphic encryption (Level 4). Crucially, it guarantees the privacy of tagged data is always maintained, prioritizing privacy above correctness.\n  AgentCrypt ensures privacy across diverse interactions and enables computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers such as data silos. We implemented and tested it with Langgraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across platforms.

While MIA has been widely investigated in NLP and vision domains, its effects on security-critical code analysis tasks remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of MIA on VP models, evaluating the attack success across various architectures (LSTM, BiGRU, and CodeBERT) and feature combinations, including embeddings, logits, loss, and confidence. Our threat model aligns with black-box and gray-box settings where prediction outputs are observable, allowing adversaries to infer membership by analyzing output discrepancies between training and non-training samples. The empirical findings reveal that logits and loss are the most informative and vulnerable outputs for membership leakage. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Noise-based Membership Inference Defense (NMID), which is a lightweight defense module that applies output masking and Gaussian noise injection to disrupt adversarial inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NMID significantly reduces MIA effectiveness, lowering the attack AUC from nearly 1.0 to below 0.65, while preserving the predictive utility of VP models.

FedMining introduces two core innovations: (1) a Decentralized Functional Encryption (DFE) scheme that keeps local models encrypted, thwarting unauthorized access and inference attacks; and (2) a balancing aggregation mechanism to mitigate data heterogeneity and enhance convergence. Evaluations on real-world mining datasets demonstrate FedMining's ability to safeguard privacy while maintaining high model accuracy and achieving rapid convergence with reduced communication and computation overhead. These advantages make FedMining both secure and practical for real-time underground safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Federated satellite learning (FSL) enables joint model training without sharing raw data, but suffers from slow convergence due to intermittent connectivity and introduces critical trust challenges--where biased or falsified updates can arise across satellite constellations, including those injected through cyberattacks on inter-satellite or satellite-ground communication links. We propose OrbitChain, a blockchain-backed framework that empowers trustworthy multi-vendor collaboration in LEO networks. OrbitChain (i) offloads consensus to high-altitude platforms (HAPs) with greater computational capacity, (ii) ensures transparent, auditable provenance of model updates from different orbits owned by different vendors, and (iii) prevents manipulated or incomplete contributions from affecting global FSL model aggregation. Extensive simulations show that OrbitChain reduces computational and communication overhead while improving privacy, security, and global model accuracy. Its permissioned proof-of-authority ledger finalizes over 1000 blocks with sub-second latency (0.16,s, 0.26,s, 0.35,s for 1-of-5, 3-of-5, and 5-of-5 quorums). Moreover, OrbitChain reduces convergence time by up to 30 hours on real satellite datasets compared to single-vendor, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time, multi-vendor learning.

Recently, Christ and Gunn (CRYPTO '24) introduced pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRCs), which are equivalent to watermarks with strong robustness and quality guarantees. A PRC is a pseudorandom encryption scheme whose decryption algorithm tolerates a high rate of errors. Pseudorandomness ensures quality preservation of the watermark, and error tolerance of decryption translates to the watermark's ability to withstand modification of the content.\n  In the short time since the introduction of PRCs, several works (NeurIPS '24, RANDOM '25, STOC '25) have proposed new constructions. Curiously, all of these constructions are vulnerable to quasipolynomial-time distinguishing attacks. Furthermore, all lack robustness to edits over a constant-sized alphabet, which is necessary for a meaningfully robust LLM watermark. Lastly, they lack robustness to adversaries who know the watermarking detection key. Until now, it was not clear whether any of these properties was achievable individually, let alone together.\n  We construct pseudorandom codes that achieve all of the above: plausible subexponential pseudorandomness security, robustness to worst-case edits over a binary alphabet, and robustness against even computationally unbounded adversaries that have the detection key. Pseudorandomness rests on a new assumption that we formalize, the permuted codes conjecture, which states that a distribution of permuted noisy codewords is pseudorandom. We show that this conjecture is implied by the permuted puzzles conjecture used previously to construct doubly efficient private information retrieval. To give further evidence, we show that the conjecture holds against a broad class of simple distinguishers, including read-once branching programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
