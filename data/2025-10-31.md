Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that
synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance
cy- bersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the
comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns,
our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph
structural relationships and tem- poral dynamics through sequential analysis of
network events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of
improved model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling
cybersecurity analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security
events - a critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection
systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed
hybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine
learning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple
evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The
model achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated
attack patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising
solution for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network
environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cyber attacks threaten economic interests, critical infrastructure, and
public health and safety. To counter this, entities adopt cyber threat hunting,
a proactive approach that involves formulating hypotheses and searching for
attack patterns within organisational networks. Automating cyber threat hunting
presents challenges, particularly in generating hypotheses, as it is a manually
created and confirmed process, making it time-consuming. To address these
challenges, we introduce APThreatHunter, an automated threat hunting solution
that generates hypotheses with minimal human intervention, eliminating analyst
bias and reducing time and cost. This is done by presenting possible risks
based on the system's current state and a set of indicators to indicate whether
any of the detected risks are happening or not. We evaluated APThreatHunter
using real-world Android malware samples, and the results revealed the
practicality of using automated planning for goal hypothesis generation in
cyber threat hunting activities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect
network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic.
Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based
classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly
vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic
classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance
transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and
effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach
(AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our
approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to
modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing
research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification;
and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic
perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against
transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend
against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be
easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted
experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively
undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification
accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.

Abstract: The rapid rise of AI agents presents urgent challenges in authentication,
authorization, and identity management. Current agent-centric protocols (like
MCP) highlight the demand for clarified best practices in authentication and
authorization. Looking ahead, ambitions for highly autonomous agents raise
complex long-term questions regarding scalable access control, agent-centric
identities, AI workload differentiation, and delegated authority. This OpenID
Foundation whitepaper is for stakeholders at the intersection of AI agents and

Abstract: Modern vehicles remain vulnerable to unauthorized use and theft despite
traditional security measures including immobilizers and keyless entry systems.
Criminals exploit vulnerabilities in Controller Area Network (CAN) bus systems
to bypass authentication mechanisms, while social media trends have expanded
auto theft to include recreational joyriding by underage drivers. Driver
authentication via CAN bus data offers a promising additional layer of
defense-in-depth protection, but existing open-access driver fingerprinting
datasets suffer from critical limitations including reliance on decoded
diagnostic data rather than raw CAN traffic, artificial fixed-route
experimental designs, insufficient sampling rates, and lack of demographic
information.
  This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing open-access driver
fingerprinting datasets, analyzing their strengths and limitations to guide
practitioners in dataset selection. We introduce the Kidmose CANid Dataset
(KCID), which addresses these fundamental shortcomings by providing raw CAN bus
data from 16 drivers across four vehicles, including essential demographic
information and both daily driving and controlled fixed-route data. Beyond
dataset contributions, we present a driver authentication anti-theft framework
and implement a proof-of-concept prototype on a single-board computer. Through
live road trials with an unaltered passenger vehicle, we demonstrate the
practical feasibility of CAN bus-based driver authentication anti-theft
systems. Finally, we explore diverse applications of KCID beyond driver
authentication, including driver profiling for insurance and safety
assessments, mechanical anomaly detection, young driver monitoring, and
impaired driving detection. This work provides researchers with both the data
and methodological foundation necessary to develop robust, deployable driver
authentication systems...

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper introduces the Agentic AI Governance Assurance & Trust Engine
(AAGATE), a Kubernetes-native control plane designed to address the unique
security and governance challenges posed by autonomous, language-model-driven
agents in production. Recognizing the limitations of traditional Application
Security (AppSec) tooling for improvisational, machine-speed systems, AAGATE
operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). It integrates
specialized security frameworks for each RMF function: the Agentic AI Threat
Modeling MAESTRO framework for Map, a hybrid of OWASP's AIVSS and SEI's SSVC
for Measure, and the Cloud Security Alliance's Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for
Manage. By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy
engine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE
provides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling
safe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended
with DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection,
and QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans
systemic, adversarial, and ethical risks.

such as Bitcoin. We provide limited-custodial protocols for such loans relying
only on trusted arbitration and provide their game-theoretical analysis. We
also highlight various interesting directions for future research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised to resolve the
long-standing paradox in honeypot design: achieving high-fidelity deception
with low operational risk. However, despite a flurry of research since late
2022, progress has been incremental, and the field lacks a cohesive
understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and
evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)
paper provides the first comprehensive overview of this new domain. We survey
and systematize three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide
a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that
LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on
LLM-honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends;
and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple
data reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these
findings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true
potential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving
deception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated
attackers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework that uses acoustic side- channel
analysis (ASCA) to monitor and verify whether a robot correctly executes its
intended commands. We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow
verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic
movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent
with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed,
direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot
movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions
using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural
Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be
identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that
acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in
sensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce a message-recovery attack based on the
Modular Knapsack Problem, applicable to all variants of the NTRU-HPS
cryptosystem. Assuming that a fraction $\epsilon$ of the coefficients of the
message ${\bf{m}}\in\{-1,0,1\}^N$ and of the nonce vector ${\bf
r}\in\{-1,0,1\}^N$ are known in advance at random positions, we reduce message
decryption to finding a short vector in a lattice that encodes an instance of a
modular knapsack system. This allows us to address a key question: how much
information about ${\bf m}$, or about the pair $({\bf m},{\bf r})$, is required
before recovery becomes feasible? A FLATTER reduction successfully recovers the
message, in practice when $\epsilon\approx 0.45$. Our implementation finds
${\bf m}$ within a few minutes on a commodity desktop.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a widely adopted privacy-protection model
in the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and
scalable nature. However, it is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and existing
defenses either incur prohibitive resource overheads or rely on domain-specific
prior knowledge, limiting their practical deployment. To address these
limitations, we propose PEEL, a Poisoning-Exposing Encoding theoretical
framework for LDP, which departs from resource- or prior-dependent
countermeasures and instead leverages the inherent structural consistency of
LDP-perturbed data. As a non-intrusive post-processing module, PEEL amplifies
stealthy poisoning effects by re-encoding LDP-perturbed data via
sparsification, normalization, and low-rank projection, thereby revealing both
output and rule poisoning attacks through structural inconsistencies in the
reconstructed space. Theoretical analysis proves that PEEL, integrated with
LDP, retains unbiasedness and statistical accuracy, while being robust to
expose both output and rule poisoning attacks. Moreover, evaluation results
show that LDP-integrated PEEL not only outperforms four state-of-the-art
defenses in terms of poisoning exposure accuracy but also significantly reduces
client-side computational costs, making it highly suitable for large-scale IoT
deployments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of security
vulnerabilities in AI-generated code across public GitHub repositories. We
collected and analyzed 7,703 files explicitly attributed to four major AI
tools: ChatGPT (91.52\%), GitHub Copilot (7.50\%), Amazon CodeWhisperer
(0.52\%), and Tabnine (0.46\%). Using CodeQL static analysis, we identified
4,241 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) instances across 77 distinct
vulnerability types. Our findings reveal that while 87.9\% of AI-generated code
does not contain identifiable CWE-mapped vulnerabilities, significant patterns
emerge regarding language-specific vulnerabilities and tool performance. Python
consistently exhibited higher vulnerability rates (16.18\%-18.50\%) compared to
JavaScript (8.66\%-8.99\%) and TypeScript (2.50\%-7.14\%) across all tools. We
observed notable differences in security performance, with GitHub Copilot
achieving better security density for Python (1,739 LOC per CWE) and
TypeScript, while ChatGPT performed better for JavaScript. Additionally, we
discovered widespread use of AI tools for documentation generation (39\% of
collected files), an understudied application with implications for software
maintainability. These findings extend previous work with a significantly
larger dataset and provide valuable insights for developing language-specific
and context-aware security practices for the responsible integration of
AI-generated code into software development workflows.

Abstract: Edge computing alleviates the computation burden of data-driven control in
cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by offloading complex processing to edge servers.
However, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for
security measures that go beyond conventional IT protections and address the
unique vulnerabilities of CPSs. This study proposes a confidential data-driven
gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption, such as ElGamal and CKKS
encryption schemes, to enhance cybersecurity in gain-tuning processes
outsourced to external servers. The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to
replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing
homomorphic operations to be applied. Numerical examples under 128-bit security
confirm performance comparable to conventional methods while providing
guidelines for selecting suitable encryption schemes for secure CPS.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Super apps are the cornerstones of modern digital life, embedding financial
transactions into nearly every aspect of daily routine. The prevailing security
paradigm for these platforms is overwhelmingly focused on pre-transaction
authentication, preventing unauthorized payments before they occur. We argue
that a critical vulnerability vector has been largely overlooked: the fragility
of post-transaction audit trails. We investigate the ease with which a user can
permanently erase their transaction history from an app's interface, thereby
concealing unauthorized or sensitive activities from the account owner. To
quantify this threat, we conducted an empirical study with 6 volunteers who
performed a cross-evaluation on six super apps. Our findings are alarming: all
six applications studied allow users to delete transaction records, yet a
staggering five out of six (83+\%) fail to protect these records with strong
authentication. Only one app in our study required biometric verification for
deletion. This study provides the first concrete evidence of this
near-ubiquitous vulnerability, demonstrating a critical gap in the current
mobile security landscape and underscoring the urgent need for a paradigm shift
towards ensuring post-transaction audit integrity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI agents capable of GUI understanding and Model Context Protocol are
increasingly deployed to automate mobile tasks. However, their reliance on
over-privileged, static permissions creates a critical vulnerability:
instruction injection. Malicious instructions, embedded in otherwise benign
content like emails, can hijack the agent to perform unauthorized actions. We
present AgentSentry, a lightweight runtime task-centric access control
framework that enforces dynamic, task-scoped permissions. Instead of granting
broad, persistent permissions, AgentSentry dynamically generates and enforces
minimal, temporary policies aligned with the user's specific task (e.g.,
register for an app), revoking them upon completion. We demonstrate that
AgentSentry successfully prevents an instruction injection attack, where an
agent is tricked into forwarding private emails, while allowing the legitimate
task to complete. Our approach highlights the urgent need for intent-aligned
security models to safely govern the next generation of autonomous agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying
insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for
ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly
important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and
static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and
temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by
incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,
enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current
research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse
modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of
standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey
of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a
taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze
representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also
review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting
their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges
related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for
future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for
advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and
practically deployable solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily relies on
large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, unauthorized commercial use of
these datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset
owners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer
from inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to
label inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical
complexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches
employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.
To address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label
backdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked
sample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,
fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The
core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three
components: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target
sample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss
maintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box
testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined
backdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential
watermark removal attacks.

combining these resources is desirable, we empirically demonstrate that naively
concatenating them results in a noisy label space that severely degrades model
performance. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce CyberNER, a
large-scale, unified corpus created by systematically harmonizing four
prominent datasets (CyNER, DNRTI, APTNER, and Attacker) onto the STIX 2.1
standard. Our principled methodology resolves semantic ambiguities and
consolidates over 50 disparate source tags into 21 coherent entity types. Our
experiments show that models trained on CyberNER achieve a substantial
performance gain, with a relative F1-score improvement of approximately 30%
over the naive concatenation baseline. By publicly releasing the CyberNER
corpus, we provide a crucial, standardized benchmark that enables the creation
and rigorous comparison of more robust and generalizable entity extraction
models for the cybersecurity domain.

Abstract: Smart home devices such as video doorbells and security cameras are becoming
increasingly common in everyday life. While these devices offer convenience and
safety, they also raise new privacy concerns: how these devices affect others,
like neighbors, visitors, or people passing by. This issue is generally known
as interdependent privacy, where one person's actions (or inaction) may impact
the privacy of others, and, specifically, bystander privacy in the context of
smart homes. Given lax data protection regulations in terms of shared physical
spaces and amateur joint data controllers, we expect that the privacy policies
of smart home products reflect the missing regulatory incentives. This paper
presents a focused privacy policy analysis of 20 video doorbell and smart
camera products, concentrating explicitly on the bystander aspect. We show that
although some of the vendors acknowledge bystanders, they address it only to
the extent of including disclaimers, shifting the ethical responsibility for
collecting the data of non-users to the device owner. In addition, we identify
and examine real-world cases related to bystander privacy, demonstrating how
current deployments can impact non-users. Based on our findings, we analyze
vendor privacy policies in light of existing legal frameworks and technical
capabilities, and we provide practical recommendations for both policy language
and system design to enhance transparency and empower both bystanders and
device owners.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of information technology, the complexity of
applications continues to increase, and the cybersecurity challenges we face
are also escalating. This paper aims to investigate the methods and practices
of system security penetration testing, exploring how to enhance system
security through systematic penetration testing processes and technical
approaches. It also examines existing penetration tools, analyzing their
strengths, weaknesses, and applicable domains to guide penetration testers in
tool selection. Furthermore, based on the penetration testing process outlined
in this paper, appropriate tools are selected to replicate attack processes
using target ranges and target machines. Finally, through practical case
analysis, lessons learned from successful attacks are summarized to inform
future research.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to transmit only task-relevant
information, thereby improving communication efficiency but also exposing
semantic information to potential eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose a
deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to
enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This
approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant
text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise.
These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic
information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to
dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant
semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the
legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's
performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose
an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated
iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the
encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method
achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak
signalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.

Abstract: Threat modeling plays a critical role in the identification and mitigation of
security risks; however, manual approaches are often labor intensive and prone
to error. This paper investigates the automation of software threat modeling
through the clustering of call graphs using density-based and community
detection algorithms, followed by an analysis of the threats associated with
the identified clusters. The proposed method was evaluated through a case study
of the Splunk Forwarder Operator (SFO), wherein selected clustering metrics
were applied to the software's call graph to assess pertinent code-density
security weaknesses. The results demonstrate the viability of the approach and
underscore its potential to facilitate systematic threat assessment. This work
contributes to the advancement of scalable, semi-automated threat modeling
frameworks tailored for modern cloud-native environments.
