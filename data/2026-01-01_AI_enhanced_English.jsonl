While recent work has demonstrated performance gains through tool learning, verifiable rewards, and continual training, deployed self-improving agents raise unresolved security and governance challenges: optimization pressure can incentivize reward hacking, behavioral drift is difficult to audit or reproduce, and improvements are often entangled in opaque parameter updates rather than reusable, verifiable artifacts.\n  This paper proposes Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework that treats self-improvement as iterative compilation of an agent into a growing, auditable skill graph. Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks. Rewards are decomposed into reconstructible components derived from replayable evidence, enabling independent audit of promotion decisions and learning signals. ASG-SI further integrates experience synthesis for scalable stress testing and continual memory control to preserve long-horizon performance under bounded context.\n  We present a complete system architecture, threat model, and security analysis, and provide a fully runnable reference implementation that demonstrates verifier-backed reward construction, skill compilation, audit logging, and measurable improvement under continual task streams. ASG-SI reframes agentic self-improvement as accumulation of verifiable, reusable capabilities, offering a practical path toward reproducible evaluation and operational governance of self-improving AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As organizations increasingly adopt multi-cluster and hybrid cloud deployments, maintaining consistent policy enforcement, predictable performance, and operational stability across heterogeneous gateway environments becomes challenging. Existing approaches typically manage security, governance, and performance as loosely coupled concerns, leading to configuration drift, delayed policy propagation, and unstable runtime behavior under dynamic workloads. This paper presents a governance-aware, intent-driven architecture for coordinated API gateway management in multi-cluster cloud environments. The proposed approach expresses security, governance, and performance objectives as high-level declarative intents, which are systematically translated into enforceable gateway configurations and continuously validated through policy verification and telemetry-driven feedback. By decoupling intent specification from enforcement while enabling bounded, policy-compliant adaptation, the architecture supports heterogeneous gateway implementations without compromising governance guarantees or service-level objectives. A prototype implementation across multiple Kubernetes clusters demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design. Experimental results show up to a 42% reduction in policy drift, a 31% improvement in configuration propagation time, and sustained p95 latency overhead below 6% under variable workloads, compared to manual and declarative baseline approaches.

EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2).

To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner.

To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience.

The scope of this paper is limited to the mathematical proof of correctness for RSA-like schemes, deliberately omitting issues related to the cryptographic security of RSA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, shifting from bit-accurate transmission to task-oriented delivery introduces new security and privacy risks. These include semantic leakage, semantic manipulation, knowledge base vulnerabilities, model-related attacks, and threats to authenticity and availability. Most existing secure SemCom studies focus on analog SemCom, where semantic features are mapped to continuous channel inputs. In contrast, digital SemCom transmits semantic information through discrete bits or symbols within practical transceiver pipelines, offering stronger compatibility with realworld systems while exposing a distinct and underexplored attack surface. In particular, digital SemCom typically represents semantic information over a finite alphabet through explicit digital modulation, following two main routes: probabilistic modulation and deterministic modulation. These discrete mechanisms and practical transmission procedures introduce additional vulnerabilities affecting bit- or symbol-level semantic information, the modulation stage, and packet-based delivery and protocol operations. Motivated by these challenges and the lack of a systematic analysis of secure digital SemCom, this paper reviews SemCom fundamentals, clarifies the architectural differences between analog and digital SemCom and their security implications, organizes the threat landscape for digital SemCom, and discusses potential defenses. Finally, we outline open research directions toward secure and deployable digital SemCom systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In scenarios where each participant is responsible for its dataset, e.g., digital forensics, MP-PSI with threshold should disclose both intersection elements and corresponding holders such that elements are traceable and the reliability of intersection is guaranteed. We refer to MP-PSI with threshold supporting traceability as Traceable Over-Threshold MP-PSI (T-OT-MP-PSI). However, research on such protocols remains limited, and existing work tolerates at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants at considerable computational cost. We propose two novel Traceable OT-MP-PSI protocols. The first, Efficient Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ET-OT-MP-PSI), combines Shamir's secret sharing with an oblivious programmable pseudorandom function, achieving significantly improved efficiency with resistance to at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants. The second, Security-enhanced Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ST-OT-MP-PSI), achieves security against up to $n-1$ semi-honest participants by further leveraging the oblivious linear evaluation protocol. Compared to Mahdavi et al.'s protocol, ours eliminate the assumption that certain special parties do not collude. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: for $n=5$, $t=3$, and sets of size $2^{14}$, ET-OT-MP-PSI achieves $15056\\times$ speedup and ST-OT-MP-PSI achieves $505\\times$ speedup over Mahdavi et al.'s protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Manual reviews and existing automated approaches, which often depend on rule-based parsing or small sets of manually crafted security requirements, fail to capture deep semantic dependencies, cross-sentence/clause relationships, and evolving specification behaviors. In this work, we present CellSecInspector, an automated framework for security analysis of 3GPP specifications. CellSecInspector extracts structured state-condition-action (SCA) representations, models mobile network procedures with comprehensive function chains, systematically validates them against 9 foundational security properties under 4 adversarial scenarios, and automatically generates test cases. This end-to-end pipeline enables the automated discovery of vulnerabilities without relying on manually predefined security requirements or rules. Applying CellSecInspector to the well-studied 5G and 4G NAS and RRC specifications, it discovers 43 vulnerabilities, 8 of which are previously unreported.

Although existing $w$-event local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms provide formal guarantees without relying on trusted third parties, their practical deployment is hindered by two key limitations. First, these methods are designed primarily for publishing simple statistics at each timestamp, making them inherently unsuitable for complex queries. Second, they handle data at each timestamp independently, failing to capture temporal correlations and consequently degrading the overall utility. To address these issues, we propose MTSP-LDP, a novel framework for \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{T}ask \\textbf{S}treaming data \\textbf{P}ublication under $w$-event LDP. MTSP-LDP adopts an \\emph{Optimal Privacy Budget Allocation} algorithm to dynamically allocate privacy budgets by analyzing temporal correlations within each window. It then constructs a \\emph{data-adaptive private binary tree structure} to support complex queries, which is further refined by cross-timestamp grouping and smoothing operations to enhance estimation accuracy. Furthermore, a unified \\emph{Budget-Free Multi-Task Processing} mechanism is introduced to support a variety of streaming queries without consuming additional privacy budget. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MTSP-LDP consistently achieves high utility across various streaming tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm toward provably secure AI. It controls risk by leveraging overlap in model output probabilities. However, we find that CS relies on frequent abstention to avoid unsafe outputs, which reduces utility. Moreover, CS becomes highly vulnerable when unsafe models are maliciously manipulated. To address these issues, we propose a new primitive called Reliable Consensus Sampling (RCS), that traces acceptance probability to tolerate extreme adversarial behaviors, improving robustness. RCS also eliminates the need for abstention entirely. We further develop a feedback algorithm to continuously and dynamically enhance the safety of RCS. We provide theoretical guarantees that RCS maintains a controllable risk threshold. Extensive experiments show that RCS significantly improves robustness and utility while maintaining latency comparable to CS. We hope this work contributes to the development of provably secure generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
