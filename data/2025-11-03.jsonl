Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our\ndataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack\nbenchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)\nmethod to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular\nmodels. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on\nattribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious\ncorrelations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes\n(color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in\nour dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's\nrealistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform\nevaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further\nexplore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of\ntraffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus\non two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance\nbetween base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework\ncontribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign\nrecognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and\ndistribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in\ndeveloping more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving\nand cyber-physical systems."}

While these guardrails often fail to interpret the\nencoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful\ninstructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with\nnegligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to\nmitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair\nEncoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that\ntokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,\nsuch as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our\ntechnique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the\naverage number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is\nmotivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules\nsuch as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a\nlarge dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with\nseveral popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT\nthreshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very\nshort inputs.
